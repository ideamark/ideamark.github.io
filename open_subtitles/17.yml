  - dave, what the hell are you doing?

- que:
  - do i really want to hear this?
  ans:
  - my imaginary friend is not imaginary.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - really.

- que:
  - she knows what a stretch this is for you.
  ans:
  - does he believe you now?

- que:
  - rock, paper or scissors?
  ans:
  - rock.

- que:
  - how...?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i love her.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - tell him thank you.

- que:
  - then why are you doing it?
  ans:
  - because someday, trust me, i'm gonna need help movir a body.

- que:
  - she's pretty, right?
  ans:
  - and she didn't make it either, because she had an accident.

- que:
  - is that why?
  ans:
  - i was supposed to meet you.

- que:
  - how did you know her?
  ans:
  - no one's called me j. j. since college.

- que:
  - how the hell did you know that?
  ans:
  - it's elizabeth.

- que:
  - dr. rushton?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - who's we?
  ans:
  - tell him your team is downstairs.

- que:
  - you won't mind if i talk to dr. walsh?
  ans:
  - this is dr. rushton.

- que:
  - well, what can i do?
  ans:
  - that's not possible.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - i can't believe we almost let you go.

- que:
  - honey?
  ans:
  - it's me, abby.

- que:
  - you don't remember david?
  ans:
  - the apartment.

- que:
  - we only rented it for a month.
  ans:
  - honey, you don't remember him at all?

- que:
  - did you move something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you sure you're gonna be ok?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how did you get up here?
  ans:
  - spare key.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - the key.

- que:
  - how do i know you?
  ans:
  - maybe from your dreams.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i knew you'd be okay.

- que:
  - hey, buddy?
  ans:
  - i'm out of the bowl.

- que:
  - you wanna trap the ape?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - live animal capture?
  ans:
  - the mayor, thank you.

- que:
  - what am i?
  ans:
  - thank you very much.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - i'm really appreciating that...

- que:
  - am i a lucky guy?
  ans:
  - maybe you're the lucky guy.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - isn't it obvious?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - and that's when he told you how he felt?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he never said it?
  ans:
  - he probably thought he didn't need to say it.

- que:
  - well, then how does she know that it's real?
  ans:
  - he said it was not about the words.

- que:
  - he didn't try to save it?
  ans:
  - i honestly believed things might actually work out... which was really very...

- que:
  - where's ann?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - everyone needs to leave, okay?
  ans:
  - look at me.

- que:
  - why'd he do that?
  ans:
  - climb up there and get himself cornered.

- que:
  - what does it matter?
  ans:
  - airplanes got him.

- que:
  - odd ball, do you copy?
  ans:
  - i see them...

- que:
  - oh?!?
  ans:
  - sorry, master.

- que:
  - next move?
  ans:
  - spring the trap.

- que:
  - what's the situation, captain?
  ans:
  - two jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - artoo.

- que:
  - do you copy?
  ans:
  - artoo.

- que:
  - artoo, do you hear me?
  ans:
  - artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

- que:
  - what was that all about?
  ans:
  - well, artoo has been...

- que:
  - chancellor.
  ans:
  - did i say anything?

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - count dooku.

- que:
  - did i miss something?
  ans:
  - hold on.

- que:
  - artoo, get down here.
  ans:
  - what is that?

- que:
  - artoo, do you copy?
  ans:
  - oh yes.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - under the circumstances, i'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

- que:
  - are you coming, master?
  ans:
  - oh no.

- que:
  - chancellor palpatine, are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes, thanks to your two jedi knights.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - you're trembling.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - something wonderful has happened.

- que:
  - we're not going to worry about anything right now, all right?
  ans:
  - this is a happy moment.

- que:
  - but the loss of count dooku?
  ans:
  - his death was a necessary loss.

- que:
  - so love has blinded you?
  ans:
  - nothing...

- que:
  - how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
  ans:
  - it was a dream.

- que:
  - bad?
  ans:
  - like the ones i used to have about my mother just before she died.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - it was about you.

- que:
  - and the baby?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you think obi wan might be able to help us?
  ans:
  - i don't need his help...

- que:
  - someone... close to you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what must i do, master yoda?
  ans:
  - train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

- que:
  - what's wrong then?
  ans:
  - the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.

- que:
  - is that bad?
  ans:
  - it will make it easier for us to end this war.

- que:
  - be careful of what?
  ans:
  - he has requested your presence.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - he would not say.

- que:
  - that's unusual, isn't it?
  ans:
  - all of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i'm depending on you.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - a master?
  ans:
  - this is outrageous, it's unfair...

- que:
  - how can you be on the council and not be a master?
  ans:
  - take a seat, young skywalker.

- que:
  - may the force be with us all.
  ans:
  - what about the droid attack on the wookiees?

- que:
  - what kind of nonsense is this, put me on the council and not make me a master!?
  ans:
  - that's never been done in the history of the jedi.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - anakin, i am on your side.

- que:
  - what situation?
  ans:
  - the council wants you to report on all of the chancellor's dealings.

- que:
  - we are at war, anakin.
  ans:
  - they want me to spy on the chancellor?

- que:
  - why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?
  ans:
  - this assignment is not to be on record.

- que:
  - why are you asking this of me?
  ans:
  - the council is asking you.

- que:
  - is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force?
  ans:
  - so the prophecy says.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i don't believe that.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you know, don't you?
  ans:
  - i know they don't trust you...

- que:
  - they asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
  ans:
  - i don't know...

- que:
  - and the jedi don't?
  ans:
  - the jedi are selfless...

- que:
  - did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis\"the wise\"?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he could actually save people from death?
  ans:
  - the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

- que:
  - it's ironic... he could save others from death, but not himself.
  ans:
  - what happened to him?

- que:
  - is it possible to learn this power?
  ans:
  - not from a jedi.

- que:
  - come on, when have i ever let you down?
  ans:
  - very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you'il arrive.

- que:
  - obi wan's been here, hasn't he?
  ans:
  - he came by this morning.

- que:
  - what did he want?
  ans:
  - he's worried about you.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - obi wan and the council don't trust me.

- que:
  - save me?
  ans:
  - from my nightmares.

- que:
  - is that what's bothering you?
  ans:
  - i won't lose you, padme.

- que:
  - what brings you to our remote sanctuary?
  ans:
  - unfortunately, the war.

- que:
  - va a traer mas guerreros?
  ans:
  - he didn't say.

- que:
  - safe?
  ans:
  - chancellor palpatine managed to escape your grip, general, without count dooku.

- que:
  - master windu, may i interrupt?
  ans:
  - general kenobi has made contact with general grievous, and we have begun our attack.

- que:
  - don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master?
  ans:
  - i wish i knew.

- que:
  - how do you know the ways of the force?
  ans:
  - my mentor taught me everything about the force... even the nature of the dark side.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - use my knowledge, i beg you...

- que:
  - are you going to kill me?
  ans:
  - i would certainly like to.

- que:
  - but you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
  ans:
  - i will quickly discover the truth of all this.

- que:
  - a sith lord?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how do you know this?
  ans:
  - he knows the ways of the force.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - master windu, may i interrupt?
  ans:
  - general kenobi has made contact with general grievous, and we have begun our attack.

- que:
  - don't you wonder why they won't make you a jedi master?

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how do you know this?
  ans:
  - he knows the ways of the force.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - are you threatening me, master jedi?
  ans:
  - the senate will decide your fate.

- que:
  - what about the other jedi spread across the galaxy?
  ans:
  - their betrayal will be dealt with.

- que:
  - what are we going to do?
  ans:
  - the chancellor's office indicated master anakin returned to the jedi temple.

- que:
  - did you find kenobi?
  ans:
  - sir, no one could have survived that fall.

- que:
  - master kenobi?
  ans:
  - repeat.

- que:
  - we're sending you our coordinates.
  ans:
  - master kenobi?

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - i heard there was an attack on the jedi temple... you can see the smoke from here.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - the jedi have tried to overthrow the republic...

- que:
  - oh, anakin what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - i will not betray the republic... my loyalties lie with the chancellor and with the senate and with you.

- que:
  - what about obi wan?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - my lady, is there anything i might do?
  ans:
  - no thank you, threepio.

- que:
  - how many other jedi managed to survive?
  ans:
  - heard from no one, have we.

- que:
  - have we had any contact from the temple?
  ans:
  - received a coded retreat message, we have.

- que:
  - suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
  ans:
  - yes, master.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - the chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the jedi, to overthrow the senate.

- que:
  - use your feelings, obi wan, and find him, you will.
  ans:
  - who?

- que:
  - when was the last time you saw him?
  ans:
  - yesterday.

- que:
  - and do you know where he is now?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - from the sith?
  ans:
  - i have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

- que:
  - you're going to kill him, aren't you?
  ans:
  - he has become a very great threat.

- que:
  - anakin is the father, isn't he?
  ans:
  - i'm so sorry.

- que:
  - what are you doing out here?
  ans:
  - i was so worried about you.

- que:
  - what things?
  ans:
  - he said you have turned to the dark side... that you killed younglings.

- que:
  - us?
  ans:
  - he knows.

- que:
  - at what cost?
  ans:
  - you are a good person.

- que:
  - because of obi wan?
  ans:
  - because of what you've done... what you plan to do.

- que:
  - your new empire?
  ans:
  - don't make me kill you.

- que:
  - surprised?
  ans:
  - your arrogance blinds you, master yoda.

- que:
  - if so powerful you are, why leave?
  ans:
  - you will not stop me.

- que:
  - for reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
  ans:
  - obi wan?

- que:
  - she's dying?
  ans:
  - we don't know why.

- que:
  - babies?
  ans:
  - she's carrying twins.

- que:
  - lord vader, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - yes, master.

- que:
  - is she safe, is she all right?
  ans:
  - it seems in your anger, you killed her.

- que:
  - and what of the boy?
  ans:
  - to tatooine.

- que:
  - training?
  ans:
  - how to commune with him.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh no.

- que:
  - odd ball, do you copy?

- que:
  - psychic powers?

  - partner?
  ans:
  - with your psychic powers and my resources...... together we can control the world.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - i'il show you a way to focus your powers...... that will make you invincible.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - now i fully perceive my power.

- que:
  - but what is my purpose?
  ans:

  ans:
  - all you gotta do, pull down your pants real quick, show 'em the goods.

- que:
  - second one is called\"the brain.\"right?
  ans:
  - what you gotta do is isolate your nuts with your fist.

- que:
  - okay, now, take the time to look at it, okay?
  ans:
  - because it bears a striking resemblance to...

- que:
  - what you do is you take the excess skin from your nuts, and you take it and you make it flat like paper, all right?
  ans:
  - now, once again, you take the time to appreciate this.

- que:
  - you gotta call 'em a fag, okay?
  ans:
  - very important.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't think i could handle the idea of you reproducing.

- que:
  - you think i wanna have kids?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - what you do is you take your nuts and your dick, right?
  ans:
  - and you tuck it underneath.

- que:
  - pull your pants down, show it, all right?
  ans:
  - with it sticking out the backside.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - okay, well, that just about covers all the different variations that we have.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah, you kind of remind me of him.

- que:
  - women troubles, amy?
  ans:
  - i just don't understand what would compel a person to be such a bitch to a total stranger.

- que:
  - so, what do you think of natasha?
  ans:
  - i think she's illegal.

- que:
  - what's up, obsession?
  ans:
  - shut up.

  ans:

  - why, then?
  ans:
  - because we need a witness to our lives.

  ans:
  - look at that.

  ans:
  - heh heh.

- que:
  - when was the last time you stopped to appreciate a good sunrise?
  ans:
  - oh, that's right.

- que:
  - you were born a vampire, so you never had the pleasure, have you?
  ans:
  - that's ok.

- que:
  - what, man?
  ans:
  - i need 12 volunteers.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - smells like a vampire wiped his ass with it.

- que:
  - so what's all this?

- que:
  - you have a lot of love for him, don't you?
  ans:
  - we have a good arrangement.

- que:
  - how you doing, chief?
  ans:
  - easy.

- que:
  - wouldn't want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, now would we?
  ans:
  - ah, it's nice to finally meet you, man.

- que:
  - hey, it's a start, right?
  ans:
  - the goal, of course, is to be like you, the daywalker.

- que:
  - you got the best of both worlds, don't you?
  ans:
  - all our strengths... none of our weaknesses.

- que:
  - oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - spare me the uncle tom routine, ok?
  ans:
  - you can't keep denying what you are, man.

- que:
  - you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you?
  ans:
  - they can't.

- que:
  - what difference does it make how their world ends?
  ans:
  - plague... war... famine.

- que:
  - what do you think, i'm stupid?
  ans:
  - you're familiar with the blood god.

- que:
  - you know that?
  ans:
  - i came down here offering you an easy way out, and you spit it right back in my fucking face.

- que:
  - what do i care?
  ans:
  - they're nothing but cattle... just like you said.

- que:
  - why do vampires need to drink blood?
  ans:
  - cause their own blood can't sustain haemoglobin.

- que:
  - you actually think this could work?
  ans:
  - on me... yes.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - blade not... giving it to you maybe.

- que:
  - is this the part where you offer to turn me?
  ans:
  - well, it's either that or a body bag.

- que:
  - how'd you get that scar, deacon?
  ans:
  - a born vampire would have the power to regenerate from birth.

- que:
  - isn't that right?
  ans:
  - vampires like you aren't a species.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - and blade's blood is the key.

- que:
  - there's no intruder where we are.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - look, make it happen, all right?
  ans:
  - but you died.

- que:
  - you're finally being reunited with your mother, and you act like this?
  ans:
  - blade, give it up.

- que:
  - who would ever guess you'd survive your mother's death?
  ans:
  - but you did.

- que:
  - nice, isn't it?
  ans:
  - apparently, these geniuses forgot it ever existed.

- que:
  - why are we here?
  ans:
  - this temple was built for one glorious moment this night, for the blood god.

- que:
  - acid etched?
  ans:
  - i'il get used to a weapon like this.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you look surprised.

- que:
  - why, man?
  ans:
  - these are they're, like, all better.

- que:
  - what do we have here?
  ans:
  - the precious serum.

- que:
  - is your blood on fire?
  ans:
  - try some.

- que:
  - it's a shame, you know?
  ans:
  - when i think of what you've become, what you should have become.

- que:
  - yeah, but he didn't turn, did he?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - curtis?
  ans:
  - ahh.

- que:
  - karen?
  ans:
  - karen.

- que:
  - i've killed... and i've enjoyed it.
  ans:
  - tell me, karen, do you ever have second thoughts about us?

- que:
  - haven't you?
  ans:
  - i know you have.

- que:
  - the blood god?
  ans:
  - that's nothing more than a fairy tale for pretty little vampires.

- que:
  - then why are you sweating, pureblood?
  ans:
  - you're afraid we're gonna steal your soul, your pureblood spirit.

- que:
  - even if frost is right, you really think he cares about you?
  ans:
  - you're gonna die, just like the rest of us.

- que:
  - is everybody thirsty?
  ans:
  - i hope you're all very fucking thirsty.

- que:
  - you wouldn't hurt your mother... would you?
  ans:
  - not anymore.

- que:
  - what, your serum?
  ans:
  - it was some guy from the community centre.

- que:
  - are you gonna do it?
  ans:
  - maybe next year, if things calm down at work a little.

- que:
  - you want to rub some lotion on my back?
  ans:
  - maybe later.

- que:
  - successive approximations to the goal, remember?
  ans:
  - god, that language just turns me on.

- que:
  - excuse me, where did you get that?
  ans:
  - this guy i work with at the museum.

- que:
  - what about the kids?
  ans:
  - they're sound asleep.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - oh, sure.

- que:
  - do you want me to take a message?
  ans:
  - i'd better see who it is.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - marnie, you know, we're sure gonna miss you.

- que:
  - slim or none?
  ans:
  - with your warmth and charm, none.

- que:
  - so, do you want to come home with me?
  ans:
  - hey, wake up.

- que:
  - what time is it?
  ans:
  - it's late.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i lied to you.

- que:
  - you remember that temp i was telling you about marnie?
  ans:
  - verna's replacement.

- que:
  - remember the pancake house where we used to take the kids last summer?
  ans:
  - the waiter there ryan.

- que:
  - what, you had an affair with him?
  ans:
  - no...... but i thought about it.

- que:
  - both times?
  ans:
  - it's not funny, alan.

- que:
  - do you think the car will be ok?
  ans:
  - it'il be fine.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - she hasn't had two kids.

- que:
  - what do you suppose this is?
  ans:

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:
  - they're all normal people.

- que:
  - can you imagine soliciting total strangers?
  ans:
  - you're right.

- que:
  - you did hide it?
  ans:
  - i did.

- que:
  - is it my birthday present?
  ans:
  - you know... i wasn't serious.

- que:
  - is that a fact?
  ans:
  - oh, i completely forgot.

- que:
  - how could i possibly face her at work the next day?
  ans:
  - that's everybody.

- que:
  - hm?
  ans:
  - we'd be in total control.

- que:
  - couldn't you find one without the kids?
  ans:
  - we'il just cut 'em out.

- que:

  ans:
  - just like that.

  ans:
  - well, let me have a shot at it.

- que:
  - did your stepfather leave any notes?
  ans:
  - there.

- que:
  - what does that represent?
  ans:
  - a werewolf's biorhythm... and how it's governed by the cycles of the moon.

  ans:
  - oh, my god.

  - a little.

- que:
  - and now, laertes, what's the news with you?
  ans:
  - you told us of some suit.

- que:
  - what wouldst thou beg, laertes?
  ans:
  - my dread lord, my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france... and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

- que:
  - what says polonius?
  ans:
  - he hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave by laborsome petition... and at last upon his will...

- que:
  - hamlet?
  ans:
  - and now, my cousin hamlet, and my son.

- que:
  - how is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  ans:
  - not so, my lord, i am too much in the sun.

- que:
  - so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven... visit her face too roughly.
  ans:
  - if it be, why seems it so particular with thee?

- que:
  - heaven and earth, must i remember?
  ans:
  - why, she would hang on him... as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on.

- que:
  - no more but so?
  ans:
  - think it no more.

- que:
  - tis in my memory locked, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  ans:
  - yet here, laertes?

- que:
  - what is it, ophelia, he hath said to you?
  ans:
  - so please you, something touching the lord hamlet.

- que:
  - do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  ans:
  - i do not know, my lord, what i should think.

- que:
  - how fare you, sirs?
  ans:
  - my lord.

- que:
  - but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?
  ans:
  - a truant's disposition, good my lord.

- que:
  - but what is your affair in elsinore?
  ans:
  - my lord, i came to see your father's funeral.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - my lord, the king your father.

- que:
  - the king, my father?
  ans:
  - season your admiration for a while with an attent ear... till i may deliver, upon the witness of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.

- que:
  - but where was this?
  ans:
  - upon the platform where we watch.

- que:
  - did you not speak to it?
  ans:
  - my lord, i did, but answer made it none.

- que:
  - hold you the watch tonight?
  ans:
  - we do, my lord.

- que:
  - what, looked he frowningly?
  ans:
  - a countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

- que:
  - and fixed his eyes upon you?
  ans:
  - ay, marry is it.

- que:
  - what hour now?
  ans:
  - it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

- que:
  - why, what should be the fear?
  ans:
  - i do not set my life at a pin's fee.

- que:
  - and for my soul, what can it do to that, being a thing immortal as itself?
  ans:
  - think of it.

- que:
  - murder?
  ans:
  - murder most foul, as in the best it is.

- que:
  - remember thee?
  ans:
  - ay, thou poor ghost... whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe.

- que:
  - remember thee?
  ans:
  - yea, from the table of my memory...

- que:
  - what news?
  ans:
  - i think it sure that i have found the very cause of hamlet's lunacy.

- que:
  - mad call i it... for, to define true madness, what is it but to be nothing else but mad?
  ans:
  - but let that go.

- que:
  - came this from hamlet to her?
  ans:
  - good madam, stay awhile.

- que:
  - what do you think of me?
  ans:
  - as of a man faithful and honorable.

- que:
  - hath there been such a time, i would fain know that... that i have positively said,\"'tis so,\"when it proved otherwise?
  ans:
  - not that i know.

- que:
  - how may we try it further?
  ans:
  - you know, sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby.

- que:
  - do you think 'tis this?
  ans:
  - i doubt it is no other but the main.

- que:
  - do you know me, my lord?
  ans:
  - excellent well.

- que:
  - honest, my lord?
  ans:
  - to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of 10, 000.

- que:
  - have you a daughter?
  ans:
  - i have, my lord.

- que:
  - what do you read, my lord?
  ans:

  ans:
  - the matter that you read.

- que:
  - good my lord... how does your honor for this many a day?
  ans:
  - i humbly thank you, well.

- que:
  - what means your lordship?
  ans:
  - that if you be honest and fair... your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

- que:
  - could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
  ans:
  - at home, my lord.

- que:
  - or to take arms against a sea of troubles... and by opposing end them?
  ans:
  - to die...

- que:
  - when he himself might his quietus make... with a bare bodkin?
  ans:
  - and lose the name of action.

- que:
  - prison, my lord?
  ans:
  - denmark's a prison.

- que:
  - shall we away?
  ans:
  - for, by my fay, i cannot reason.

- que:
  - what make you at elsinore?
  ans:
  - to visit you, my lord.

- que:
  - is it a free visitation?
  ans:
  - come, come, deal justly with me.

- que:
  - what should we say?
  ans:
  - why, anything, but to the purpose.

- que:
  - to what end?
  ans:
  - that you must teach me.

- que:
  - and yet, to me... what is this quintessence of dust?
  ans:
  - man delights not me.

- que:
  - when i said,\"man delights not me\"?
  ans:
  - to think, if you delight not in man... what lenten entertainment the players shall receive.

- que:
  - good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?
  ans:
  - for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.

- que:
  - use every man after his desert, and who shall escape whipping?
  ans:
  - take them in.

- que:
  - in what, my dear lord?
  ans:
  - i am but mad north north west.

- que:
  - for the law of writ and the liberty... these are the only men.
  ans:
  - am i a coward?

- que:
  - my lord, you played once for the university, you say?
  ans:
  - that did i, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.

- que:
  - what did you enact?
  ans:
  - i did enact julius caesar.

- que:
  - how fares our cousin hamlet?
  ans:
  - excellent, in faith, of the chameleon's dish.

- que:
  - lady, shall i lie in your lap?
  ans:
  - no, my lord.

- que:
  - i mean, my head upon your lap?
  ans:
  - ay, my lord.

- que:
  - do you think i meant country matters?
  ans:
  - i think nothing, my lord.

- que:
  - what is, my lord?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - who, i?
  ans:
  - ay, my lord.

- que:
  - what should a man do but be merry?
  ans:
  - for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks... and my father died within's two hours.

- que:
  - o heavens, die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
  ans:
  - there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year.

- que:
  - why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?
  ans:
  - i am myself indifferent honest, but yet i could accuse me of such things... it were better my mother had not borne me.

- que:
  - what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven?
  ans:
  - believe none of us.

- que:
  - is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  ans:
  - indeed, 'tis brief, my son.

- que:
  - madam, how like you this play?
  ans:
  - the lady doth protest too much, methinks.

- que:
  - is there no offense in it?
  ans:
  - no, they do but jest... poison in jest.

- que:
  - what do you call the play?
  ans:
  - the mousetrap.

- que:
  - tis a knavish piece of work, but what of that?
  ans:
  - your majesty and i have free souls, it touches us not.

- que:
  - how fares my lord?
  ans:
  - give me some...

- que:
  - didst perceive?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - upon the talk of the poisoning?
  ans:
  - i did very well...

- que:
  - ay, sir, what of him?
  ans:
  - is in his retirement marvelous distempered.

- que:
  - with drink, sir?
  ans:
  - no, my lord, rather with choler.

- que:
  - what, my lord?
  ans:
  - you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty... if you deny your griefs to your friend.

- que:
  - will you play upon this pipe?
  ans:
  - i cannot, my lord.

- que:
  - god's blood, do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe?
  ans:
  - i will come to my mother by and by.

- que:
  - now, mother, what's the matter?
  ans:
  - hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

- que:
  - have you forgot me?
  ans:
  - no, by the rood, not so.

- que:
  - o me, what hast thou done?
  ans:
  - nay, i know not.

- que:
  - almost as bad, good mother... as kill a king and marry with his brother.
  ans:
  - is it the king?

- que:
  - as kill a king?
  ans:
  - aye, lady, it was my word.

- que:
  - what have i done, that thou darest wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me?
  ans:
  - such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty... calls virtue hypocrite... makes marriage vows as false as dicers 'oaths.

- que:
  - ay me, what act?
  ans:
  - look here, upon this picture, and on this.

- que:
  - have you eyes?
  ans:
  - you cannot call it love... for at your age, the heyday in the blood is tame... it's humble, and waits upon the judgment.

- que:
  - and what judgment would step from this to this?
  ans:
  - eyes without feeling, feeling without sight.

- que:
  - o shame, where is thy blush?
  ans:
  - speak no more.

- que:
  - what would your gracious figure?
  ans:
  - alas, he's mad.

- que:
  - do you not come your tardy son to chide?
  ans:
  - oh, say.

- que:
  - alas, how is it with you, that you do bend your eye on vacancy... and with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
  ans:
  - o gentle son, say whereon do you look.

- que:
  - do you see nothing there?
  ans:
  - nothing at all.

- que:
  - nor did you nothing hear?
  ans:
  - no, nothing but ourselves.

- que:
  - what shall i do?
  ans:
  - where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, we could not get from him.

- que:
  - now, hamlet... where's polonius?
  ans:
  - at supper.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

- que:
  - what dost thou mean by this?
  ans:
  - nothing... but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.

- que:
  - where is polonius?
  ans:
  - in heaven.

- que:
  - for england?
  ans:
  - ay, hamlet.

- que:
  - you know that?
  ans:
  - alas.

- que:
  - so full of artless jealousy is guilt... it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  ans:
  - how should i your true love know from another one?

- que:
  - where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?
  ans:
  - where is the...

- que:
  - where is the king?
  ans:
  - stay, my lord laertes.

- que:
  - where is my father?
  ans:
  - dead.

- que:
  - o heavens, is it possible a young maid's wits... should be as mortal as an old man's life?
  ans:
  - mine, sir.

- que:
  - what man dost thou dig it for?
  ans:
  - for no man, sir.

- que:
  - what woman, then?
  ans:
  - for none, neither.

- que:
  - who is to be buried in it?
  ans:
  - one that was a woman, sir.

- que:
  - how long hast thou been grave maker?
  ans:
  - since that very day that young hamlet was born.

- que:
  - ay, marry, why was he sent into england?
  ans:
  - why, because he was mad.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - twill not be seen in him there.

- que:
  - how long will a man lie in the earth ere he rot?
  ans:
  - faith, if he be not rotten before he die, some eight year, nine year.

- que:
  - whose was it?
  ans:
  - a whoreson mad fellow's it was.

- que:
  - whose do you think it was?
  ans:
  - nay, i know not.

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - e'en that.

- que:
  - quite chopfallen?
  ans:
  - now get you to my lady's chamber... and tell her...

- que:
  - who is this they follow?
  ans:
  - lay her in the earth.

- que:
  - i pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
  ans:
  - what wilt thou do for her?

- que:
  - will you be ruled by me?
  ans:
  - i will, my lord, so you will not overrule me to a peace.

- que:
  - but tell me, sir... why you proceeded not against these crimes so capital in nature?
  ans:
  - the queen his mother lives almost by his looks.

- que:
  - why ask you this?
  ans:
  - not that i think you did not love your father.

- que:
  - but, laertes... what would you undertake to show yourself your father's son... in deed more than in words?
  ans:
  - to cut his throat in the church.

- que:
  - shall i deliver you even so?
  ans:
  - if his fitness speaks, mine is ready... now or whensoever, provided i be so able as now.

- que:
  - cousin hamlet, you know the wager?
  ans:
  - a touch, i do confess.

- que:
  - they bleed on both sides.
  ans:
  - say you so?

- que:
  - here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane... drink of this potion.
  ans:
  - how does my lord?

- que:
  - for rome, or for you?
  ans:
  - my father spent all his time at study... at books of learning and philosophy.

- que:
  - have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
  ans:
  - no, but if you interrupt me again...

- que:
  - who are they to lecture me?
  ans:
  - commodus, the senate has its uses.

- que:
  - what uses?
  ans:
  - traditions.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - they didn't see the battles.

  - well, what is that?
  ans:
  - it's an idea greatness.

- que:

  - what will you do?
  ans:
  - this way.

  - how you doing?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - do me a favor, will you?
  ans:
  - shut the fuck up.

- que:
  - open?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - would you like some water?
  ans:
  - carney versus massachusetts general hospital case number 812725.

- que:
  - why does their pain become my pain?
  ans:
  - i wish i could find some way not to empathize.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - sounds pretty.

- que:
  - how come you never call me?
  ans:
  - believe me, if i had your number, i would call you.

- que:
  - is this ricky?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - we are?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, what was your name?
  ans:
  - anne...

- que:
  - why don't you come up to woburn one of these days and actually meet a few of those people whose pain is your pain...... jan?
  ans:
  - let me try and picture how this happened.

- que:
  - is that unusual?
  ans:
  - apparently, statistically.

- que:
  - this woman lost a child?
  ans:
  - they think it has something to do with the city's drinking water which they say has always tasted funny.

- que:
  - what was she like before?
  ans:
  - i'd like to know that.

- que:
  - to prove something like this, you need new medical research.
  ans:
  - do want to hear what it's about?

- que:
  - and... and you have to ask yourself, why is this an orphan?
  ans:
  - why has it been kicked from firm to firm before it ended up on your desk.

- que:
  - from who?
  ans:
  - from whoever did this.

- que:
  - but who is that?
  ans:
  - well, we don't know.

- que:
  - who is going to apologize to you and pay me?
  ans:
  - there has to be a defendant and one with very deep pockets.

- que:
  - a tannery?
  ans:
  - and some other small factories.

- que:
  - what would that... what would that accomplish?
  ans:
  - i do hope you find someone.

- que:
  - and the other one?
  ans:
  - w. r. grace.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - that's the ticket.

- que:
  - when did he ask me?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - on your lunch break?
  ans:
  - that hardly seems fair.

- que:
  - how you doing?
  ans:
  - well, all right, i guess, under the circumstances.

- que:
  - what circumstances are those?
  ans:
  - woburn... these outrageous charges.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - we're co defendants in a lawsuit, mr facher, a very serious lawsuit.

- que:
  - what is that thumping?
  ans:
  - yeah, well, it's gone now.

- que:
  - what's on your mind?
  ans:
  - well, i'il tell you what i'm thinking.

- que:
  - with what?
  ans:
  - mr...

- que:
  - cheeseman, is it?
  ans:
  - mr cheeseman.

- que:
  - when you get a fine what do you do?
  ans:
  - you pay it and go back to business.

- que:
  - what are you looking for with this suit?
  ans:
  - well, obviously, we'il be seeking compensation for the families and punitive damages for the willful negligence of these two companies.

- que:
  - but is that what this is really all about... money?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that what matters most to any of us?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what does that have to do with anything?
  ans:
  - it clouds his judgement, and that's as beneficial to his client as a doctor who recoils at the sight of blood.

- que:
  - is this the only case?
  ans:
  - this is a lot of lawyers.

- que:
  - you have some interest in this case?
  ans:
  - i'm a co defendant, so i guess i do have an interest, but it's not my motion.

- que:
  - and that motion is?
  ans:
  - your honor, if i might.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - mr schlichtmann, you are a personal injury lawyer, are you not?
  ans:
  - i think you'il survive that.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - it's starting already.

- que:
  - do you think i might at least hear this motion before you explain to me what it's really about?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - your motion to dismiss is based on?
  ans:
  - rule 11, your honor.

- que:
  - do you know what rule 11 is, mr schlichtmann?
  ans:
  - well, to be honest with you, your honor, i had to look it up.

- que:
  - so did i. do you know why, mr cheeseman?
  ans:
  - because it is so old and ambiguous few lawyers waste their time with it, or mine.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - no, your honor.

- que:
  - and you're talking about you and a couple of assistants, or something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - a team?
  ans:
  - a big team.

- que:
  - used solvent?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and, er, what would you do with those drums when they were filled up?
  ans:
  - don't know.

- que:
  - they were just gone?
  ans:
  - never noticed.

- que:
  - you never dumped them out back?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - never noticed anyone who did?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what were your duties at grace back then, mr shalline?
  ans:
  - oversee disposal and discharge to the drains.

- que:
  - you never heard anything about this?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - back then in 1965 or thereafter did you clean metal parts with any type of solvent?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what kind?
  ans:
  - that i couldn't tell you.

- que:
  - did you ever notice the name trichlorethylene or tce?
  ans:
  - no, i don't know.

- que:
  - but you'd put it in barrels when you were done with it, that seems to be the process, right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you ever see what happened to these barrels of solvent when you were through with them?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - they get dumped.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - out back, in the ground.

- que:
  - you saw this?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - my coffee break.

- que:
  - do you need a break?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - the names of people.

- que:
  - mr love, do you have any children?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - that's quite a family.
  ans:
  - eight?

- que:
  - now?
  ans:
  - it's all right.

- que:
  - what about then, 10, 15 years ago?
  ans:
  - it had an odor then.

- que:
  - did you drink it?
  ans:
  - yeah, i drank it.

- que:
  - the kids?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - were you concerned when you found out that the wells were contaminated?
  ans:
  - i'm going to object to that.

- que:
  - for your family's health?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - has any member of your family had any illness out of the ordinary?
  ans:
  - you don't have to answer any of these type of questions.

- que:
  - what kind?
  ans:
  - one of my sons has a seizure disorder, my eldest daughter has had two miscarriages and my youngest boy was born with...

- que:
  - are we going to sit here all day and go through his entire family's medical history?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - i just do.

- que:
  - look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them up in the air, about half of them would land heads and the other half tails, right?
  ans:
  - now, if i looked around closely, i'd probably find some heads grouped together in a cluster.

- que:
  - does that mean anything?
  ans:
  - you see, no one knows what causes leukemia, al.

- que:
  - do you eat peanut butter?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you've never eaten peanut butter?
  ans:
  - i guess everyone alive has probably tried it, but i'm not exactly what you'd call a peanut butter fan.

- que:
  - do you eat bacon?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you have silver fillings in your teeth?
  ans:
  - so, you were aware when you moved to woburn that its water didn't taste good.

- que:
  - did you ever consider using bottled water?
  ans:
  - we used bottled water off and on, split half and half.

- que:
  - has any doctor ever told you that you had any dysfunction of your immune system?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why did you have an autopsy?
  ans:
  - because he was doing good.

- que:
  - did you talk to the doctor about this?
  ans:
  - i had more like a violent talk with him.

- que:
  - you were angry?
  ans:
  - yelling at him.

- que:
  - he was in remission?
  ans:
  - you were optimistic about his future and suddenly he became ill and died.

- que:
  - you try to explain on the phone and they say,\"has he got a temperature?
  ans:
  - you say,\"no.\"\"he's all right, then,\"they say.

- que:
  - he was in the clinic when he died?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - he died in the car on the way to the clinic?
  ans:
  - he died on i 93, up by the somerville exit.

  - what the fuck is this?
  ans:
  - no, no, you keep that.

- que:
  - these two chemicals mixed together are used to waterproof leather, are they not?
  ans:
  - i asked you a question, mr riley... again.

- que:
  - what exactly do you intend to say to me, mr riley, by pouring water on my table?
  ans:
  - this is how silicone is put on leather to waterproof it.

- que:
  - did i say tce?
  ans:
  - i didn't say tce.

- que:
  - your invoices, purchase orders and formulas?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you want me to go back out there?
  ans:
  - this is the case against beatrice, this liar.

- que:

  ans:
  - almost.

- que:
  - you want to just get out now and throw away 900 and... what is it?
  ans:
  - 1. 4 million dollars.

- que:
  - how much of it?
  ans:

  - two, three hundred?
  ans:
  - 600, 000.

- que:

- que:
  - 50?
  ans:
  - or more.

- que:
  - is there anyone else at the plant that might talk to me?
  ans:

- que:
  - bobby?
  ans:
  - he might.

- que:
  - could you call him?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's the stuff got dumped.

- que:

  ans:
  - dumped it back there in the gully right there.

- que:
  - tommy?
  ans:
  - no, not tommy, no.

- que:
  - never did anything like that?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - is that how you remember it now that your memory's been refreshed?
  ans:
  - that's what we called it... the swimming pool.

- que:
  - so why does anyone do it?
  ans:
  - business is good.

- que:
  - is it?
  ans:
  - that's good.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - you don't have to worry, jerry.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - you don't want me in this case.

- que:
  - you're offering to cover my expenses?
  ans:
  - your expenses and your pride.

- que:
  - do you really think i'd let that happen?
  ans:
  - i don't see how you can prevent it.

- que:
  - jan, guess what?
  ans:
  - cheeseman called.

- que:
  - are the red sox in town?
  ans:
  - sorry i'm late.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's black with arms, with my name on a brass plate on the back.

- que:
  - jerry, ever thought about getting yourself a new briefcase?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - am i sitting in the right place?
  ans:
  - well, actually, we have a seat for you here, but that's fine.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - this is a good quality pen.

- que:
  - how much did grace make last year?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - 436 million dollars.

- que:
  - to compensate the families, to provide for their economic security in the future?
  ans:
  - don't forget to mention you compensating you.

- que:
  - can i ask a question?
  ans:
  - i'm sure everyone has questions.

- que:
  - can i have this?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - what's the story?
  ans:
  - well i guess they just don't want to end this thing.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - we can't afford a long drawn out trial.

- que:
  - am i the financial advisor around here?
  ans:
  - no, you're not.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - to evaporate.

- que:
  - did they?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who needs them?
  ans:
  - and call the janitorial people, tell them their services are no longer required.

- que:
  - how much can i send you right now?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - if you should fall asleep at the council table, the first thing you say when you wake up should be...
  ans:
  - you got a winner there?

- que:
  - eh...?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - would you care for a glass of water?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - now the single greatest liability a lawyer can have is pride.

- que:
  - mr riley, you own the property referred to often in this courtroom as the 15 acres, do you not?
  ans:
  - no, i don't.

- que:
  - some kind of conservation group?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - now you have no idea how it got that way?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - does it upset you to learn this?
  ans:
  - very much so.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - and one last thing, unless you know exactly what the answer's going to be, never, ever ask a witness\"why\".

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you're just noticing now?
  ans:
  - gordon laid everybody off two weeks ago.

- que:
  - gordon, instead of sitting there reading a magazine, why don't you go to uncle pete and get me a staff?
  ans:
  - that's a good idea.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - yes, i was told there was a cheeseman on the mayflower.

- que:
  - you've been talking without my being present?
  ans:
  - no, we have been drinking coffee without your being present.

- que:
  - jerry?
  ans:
  - last night, i was at a ball game.

- que:
  - chemicals?
  ans:
  - poisons.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i think i'd have to agree with that.

- que:
  - what don't you understand?
  ans:
  - they're straightforward questions.

- que:
  - from out of a hat?
  ans:
  - question two.

- que:
  - well how can they determine that?
  ans:
  - science can't even determine when the chemicals arrived at the wells with the precision that you're asking of the jurors.

- que:
  - but what does that mean?
  ans:
  - it's like english translated into japanese back into english again.

- que:
  - for who?
  ans:
  - for me, of course.

- que:
  - you think?
  ans:
  - well, here's my take.

- que:
  - what's your take?
  ans:
  - they'il see the truth.

- que:
  - the truth?
  ans:
  - i thought we were talking about a court of law.

- que:
  - well, since when?
  ans:
  - eight kids are dead, jerry.

- que:
  - that's not how you made all that money all these years, is it?
  ans:
  - you want to know when this case stopped being about dead children? the minute you filed the complaint.

- que:
  - why don't we test your born again faith in the righteousness of our courts with a high stakes gamble?
  ans:
  - if that's a settlement offer, jerry, it's not enough.

- que:
  - who said that?
  ans:
  - the irs, telling us they have a lien on any eventual settlement in order to recover over two and a half million dollars in unpaid taxes.

- que:
  - what if i would add six zeros onto that?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - let's get the decision makers together and talk seriously.
  ans:
  - now, that would put things in perspective for you, wouldn't it?

- que:
  - the decision makers are here, aren't they?
  ans:
  - you're looking at mr beatrice.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - it's just you and me.

- que:
  - mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
  ans:
  - yes, your honor.

- que:
  - disappointed?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - right now?
  ans:
  - i think we should celebrate, have some champagne.

- que:
  - so you intend to go forward with your claims against grace, no matter how long it takes?
  ans:
  - we have to get out of this case as fast as we can.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - farmers 'bank of iowa.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - sorry i'm late.

- que:
  - you got lost?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how did you manage that?
  ans:
  - i've never been here before so...

- que:
  - never been here before, what kind of harvard man are you?
  ans:
  - the cornell kind.

- que:
  - damn good.
  ans:
  - cornell?

- que:
  - so what do you want?
  ans:
  - well, i could take you through it step by step or, if you prefer, you could take this with you and study it.

- que:
  - i meant, what do you want to drink?
  ans:
  - i wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.

- que:
  - you sail?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you don't sail?
  ans:
  - finally, we went to his office.

- que:
  - he said 8 million?
  ans:
  - i can't go to them empty handed.

- que:
  - i owe them more than that.
  ans:
  - what are you talking about?

- que:
  - it isn't worth it, jan.
  ans:
  - you owe them?

- que:
  - nobody calls any more?
  ans:
  - not even the creditors.

- que:
  - are the phones still working?
  ans:
  - schlichtmann, conway and crowley.

- que:
  - do i look like i'm here?
  ans:
  - he's in a meeting at the moment.

- que:
  - do me a favor, gordon, will you?
  ans:
  - shut up.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm so tired of hearing you moan about money all the time.

- que:
  - what's it about, jan?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but you won't take eight?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do i have?
  ans:
  - i got a couple of bucks and some bus transfers.

- que:
  - and they're gonna clean the place up?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - would you call this an apology?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how can you even begin to compare what you've lost to what we've lost?
  ans:
  - listen, the minute you put money on the table, things turn ugly.

- que:
  - they've had it, they want out, right?
  ans:
  - it's time they went their separate way.

- que:
  - you know what i think of that?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - so what if we have to start over?
  ans:
  - we did it once.

- que:
  - and what did you do?
  ans:
  - you let him in the door.

- que:
  - mr granger?
  ans:
  - i don't have to talk to you.

- que:
  - did he tell you why?
  ans:
  - yes, he did.

- que:
  - lighting fire crackers, drinking beers?
  ans:
  - i've nothing to say to you.

- que:
  - did riley threaten you in any way, with what might happen to you if you ever came forward?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - he didn't say anything at all to you in this regard?
  ans:
  - he gave me a couple of celtics tickets.

- que:
  - mr facher?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - mr schlichtmann?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - the purpose of these questions is not to embarrass or humiliate you, but rather to verify the information you've declared as your assets.

- que:
  - that after 17 years of practicing law, all you have to show for it is... 14 dollars in a chequing account and a portable radio?
  ans:
  - that's correct.

- que:
  - the money?
  ans:
  - the money, the property, the personal belongings.

- que:
  - where are you hurt?
  ans:
  - you must be one of the scavengers who search soldiers corpses for valuables.

- que:
  - what is?
  ans:
  - hiding them here.

- que:
  - afraid they will come looking for defeated soldiers?
  ans:
  - we will worry about it when the time comes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you didn't get hurt.

- que:
  - otsu san...
  ans:
  - who got me into this...?

- que:
  - do you dream of matahachi?
  ans:
  - yes, many times.

- que:
  - how will we face them?
  ans:
  - i'il apologize to granny and to otsu.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - the coming winter.

- que:
  - winter?
  ans:
  - it's depressing.

- que:
  - akemi chan, why do you and your mother live so dangerously?
  ans:
  - we can't make a living by selling moxa only.

- que:
  - so, akemi chan is one of them?
  ans:
  - i'm just a child of the wilderness.

- que:
  - akemi chan.
  ans:
  - hey, you know what?

- que:
  - why do you have that bell on your sleeve?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

- que:
  - doesn't it sound beautiful?
  ans:
  - i sewed these for you.

- que:

  ans:
  - never mind.

- que:
  - never mind?
  ans:
  - you're acting so strange.

- que:
  - go home?
  ans:
  - right now.

- que:
  - without telling the family?
  ans:
  - i think it's best.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - but...

  - to who?
  ans:
  - your son, matahachi.

- que:
  - i'm wondering where he's hiding?
  ans:
  - we've yet to find any trace of him.

- que:
  - otsu, did you hear that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yes, that's right.

- que:
  - i see.
  ans:
  - are you a shinmen?

- que:
  - then, you're the famous hon'iden granny?
  ans:
  - i heard matahachi died at sekigahara.

- que:
  - which one is takezo's sister?
  ans:
  - don't be rude as i'm a woman living alone.

- que:
  - the bath?
  ans:
  - it's this way.

- que:
  - you're...?
  ans:
  - granny, i came to see you.

- que:
  - what happened to matahachi?
  ans:
  - granny, matahachi is alive.

- que:
  - where are you going now?
  ans:
  - first, i plan to... see my sister and then i intend to leave miyamoto village.

- que:
  - aren't you hungry?
  ans:
  - haven't eaten for days.

- que:
  - how's the water temperature?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - uh, otsu san?
  ans:
  - you look pale.

- que:
  - this is fortunate for you.
  ans:
  - for me?

- que:
  - if you became his wife... and he sent this letter, what would you do then?
  ans:
  - if i were you, i would be happy.

- que:
  - otsu, are you in?
  ans:
  - there you are.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - please go.

- que:
  - come sit here and relax.
  ans:
  - okay?

- que:
  - are you angry?
  ans:
  - it's been twenty days and you still can't capture takezo.

- que:
  - you will?
  ans:
  - how interesting.

- que:
  - you're his retainer, but you haven't heard?
  ans:
  - terumasa and i are very good friends.

- que:
  - you think i'm kidding?
  ans:
  - no, but...

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - including officers, footsoldiers and farmers...

- que:
  - you can't?
  ans:
  - about takezo's treatment after i capture him...

- que:
  - you can't?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - what will you do?
  ans:
  - i will hang myself on the 1, 000 year old cedar.

- que:
  - hang yourself?
  ans:
  - otsu san...

- que:
  - they placed these here to trap takezo san, didn't they?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why do the villagers despise takezo so much?
  ans:
  - some force must make them that way.

- que:
  - is it inside a man's heart?
  ans:
  - but takezo is also at fault.

- que:
  - leaving a man like takezo on the loose... means lives may be lost daily.
  ans:
  - takuan san, do you also hate takezo san?

- que:
  - would you not agree, otsu san?
  ans:
  - i wish to know why he chose to return here... despite all the danger.

- que:
  - also, what kind of woman matahachi is with?
  ans:
  - i want to hear that from takezo san.

- que:
  - what are you looking at?
  ans:
  - he should be appearing soon.

- que:
  - you mean takezo san?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who would come to get captured?
  ans:
  - no, no...

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - today is the third day...

- que:
  - then, why don't you go looking for him?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't be able to find him... not in these hills.

- que:
  - my flute?
  ans:
  - any tune will do.

- que:
  - can't you tell, otsu san?
  ans:
  - look, takezo is there.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - actually, we're here to capture you.

- que:
  - you came knowing that?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - there is the law of the clan.

- que:
  - win what?
  ans:
  - i mean win over yourself.

- que:
  - now, i have to ask you for advice.
  ans:
  - how will you face your ancestors?

- que:
  - but i will take custody of takezo.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - mustache man... you intend to break your promise as a samurai?
  ans:
  - no sense in letting a captured man free.

- que:
  - you must be kidding?
  ans:
  - priests tend to funerals.

- que:
  - sir, a messenger is here.
  ans:
  - why don't we hang takezo from this tree and expose him to the wind and and the rain... and let the crows feed on his eyes?

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - aoki dono, it's a message from the lord.

- que:
  - otsu, are you one of them?
  ans:
  - otsu... you must be tired.

- que:
  - you're sure?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why don't you leave the temple... and move to the hon'iden residence?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - you want me?
  ans:
  - who else will marry matahachi.

- que:
  - i don't have to leave the temple as of yet?
  ans:
  - you can't do two jobs at once.

- que:
  - understood?
  ans:
  - this is an order.

- que:
  - aoki dono?
  ans:
  - hello, otsu dono.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - i'il give you this letter.

- que:
  - was that your only mistake?
  ans:
  - it's more like everything was a mistake.

- que:
  - no, you may not have enough time?
  ans:
  - oh, granny.

- que:
  - wasn't that a terrible storm last night?
  ans:
  - but such a good storm.

- que:
  - why didn't you use your strength and youth more constructively?
  ans:
  - i'il come up to save you.

- que:
  - you're saving me?
  ans:
  - yes, i will.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - the top of mount nagayama.

- que:
  - priest takuan and otsu are gone.
  ans:
  - you will let me go?

- que:
  - takezo... about your sister ogin...
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - is my sister safe?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - to my sister?
  ans:
  - never mind where.

- que:
  - you'il let me see her?
  ans:
  - yes, there is someone i would like you to meet.

- que:
  - then, will you allow me to handle him?
  ans:
  - granted.

- que:
  - how will you handle him?
  ans:
  - i heard that ghosts dwell within the attic of this castle.

- que:
  - you mean the same blood that flows through my body?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - alright, takezo?
  ans:
  - over there, you will find the writings of japanese and chinese scholars.

- que:
  - how is your condition?
  ans:
  - much better.

- que:
  - see anything else?
  ans:
  - no, nothing.

- que:
  - what will i find?

  - there is no shame in this.

- que:
  - lf you let the hebrews go, who will build hls cities?
  ans:
  - you told moses to make bricks without straw.

- que:
  - will you now free my people?
  ans:

  - what have you done to moses?

- que:
  - who mourns him now?
  ans:
  - not even you.

- que:
  - hls god?
  ans:
  - the priests say that pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.

- que:
  - shall i tell you what happened, rameses?
  ans:
  - he spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.

- que:
  - war crown.
  ans:
  - do you hear laughter, pharaoh?

- que:
  - over the sea?
  ans:
  - no, it comes from the desert.
