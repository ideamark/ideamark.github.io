- que:
  - i mean, we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?
  ans:
  - i mean, i always think of thomas wolfe.

- que:
  - have you ever seen that little one page\\"note to reader\"...... in the front of look homeward, angel?
  ans:
  - so when i look at my own life, i have to admit, right, that i...

- que:
  - but my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right?
  ans:
  - and so i thought, if i could write a book...... that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody...

- que:
  - did i answer your question?
  ans:
  - i'il try to be more specific.

- que:
  - was there ever a french young woman on a train you met...... and spent an evening with?
  ans:
  - see, to me, that...

- que:
  - so that's a yes?
  ans:
  - all right, since i'm in france and this is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

- que:
  - like they promised?
  ans:
  - i think how you answer that, you know, is...

- que:
  - i mean, you think they get back together, right?
  ans:
  - you don't, for sure.

- que:
  - did i in real...?
  ans:
  - to answer that would take the piss out of the whole thing.

- que:
  - what is your next book?
  ans:
  - i don't know, man.

- que:
  - happiness is in the doing, right?
  ans:
  - not in the getting what you want.

- que:
  - how much longer before i have to go to the airport?
  ans:
  - oh, you should leave at 7:30...

- que:
  - good, and you?

  ans:
  - yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

  ans:
  - this is so weird.

- que:
  - so you want to go to a caf?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how did you know i was gonna be here?
  ans:
  - it's my favorite bookstore in paris.

- que:
  - vaguely?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you have a chance to read it?
  ans:
  - yes, i...

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - before we go anywhere, i have to ask you...

- que:
  - did you?
  ans:
  - no, i couldn't.

- que:
  - but did you?
  ans:
  - i need to know.

- que:
  - well, did you?
  ans:

  - did you hate me?
  ans:
  - you must've hated me.

- que:
  - have you been hating me all this time?
  ans:

  ans:
  - just a couple hookers looking for a gig.

- que:
  - no, it was awful, i mean, what do you want me to say?
  ans:
  - it's so sad.

- que:
  - what did he tell you about french women?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - why didn't you put,\\"six months later, the french bitch didn't show up\"?
  ans:
  - no, but i did, i did.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - oh, what happens?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we make love for about 10 days straight, that's one part of it.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah, exactly.

- que:
  - so things are going well for you, right?
  ans:
  - i mean...

- que:
  - why should they read my book?
  ans:
  - i haven't read moby dick and i liked your book.

- que:
  - come on, it's fiction, right?
  ans:
  - i'm supposed to...

- que:
  - well, i mean, her, right?
  ans:
  - no, me.

- que:
  - you think i'm neurotic?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - where did i do that?
  ans:
  - i didn't do that.

- que:
  - how is it disturbing?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how long did it take you to write it?
  ans:
  - three or four years, on and off.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i've wanted to talk to you for so long that now...

- que:
  - it's just surreal, you know?
  ans:
  - i feel like everything should be...

- que:
  - twenty minutes and 30 seconds?
  ans:
  - we got more than that.

- que:
  - where to start?
  ans:
  - i work for green cross.

- que:
  - what are they all about?
  ans:
  - we basically work on different environment issues...... from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.

- que:
  - what do you do for them?
  ans:
  - we're going this way.

- que:
  - but how'd you get into that?
  ans:
  - i came out of political science, hoping to work for the government.

- que:
  - not good?
  ans:
  - yeah, no.

- que:
  - so i decided what i really wanted to do was...... to find things that could be fixed and try to fix them, you know?
  ans:
  - you know, i always thought you'd be doing something cool like that.

- que:
  - i just feel really, really lucky to be doing a job i like, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how could you possibly say that?
  ans:
  - well, i just mean, you know, like...

- que:
  - how is the world getting better?
  ans:
  - i'm not angry, i'm not angry.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - stop.

- que:
  - is there any particular imperialist country you have in mind, there, frenchie?
  ans:
  - no, not really.

- que:
  - so you wanna sit over there?
  ans:
  - yeah, this is perfect.

- que:
  - am i improving?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - when i was younger, i was healthier...... but i was wracked with insecurity, you know?
  ans:
  - now i'm older and my problems are deeper...... but i'm more equipped to handle them.

- que:
  - so, what are your problems?
  ans:
  - right now i don't have any.

- que:
  - i don't, you know?
  ans:
  - i'm just...... damn happy to be here.

- que:
  - so how long have you been in paris?
  ans:
  - i got in last night.

- que:
  - i'm so glad it's over, you know?
  ans:
  - i'm tired of being a huckster.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - a cup of coffee.

- que:
  - you were living in the u. s.?
  ans:
  - yes, from '96 to '99.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no, it's just...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i've been living in new york since '98.

- que:
  - in new york?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it actually crossed my mind a few times that i might run into you...... but the odds are so slim, right?
  ans:
  - so...

- que:
  - weren't you somewhere in texas?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, definitely.

- que:
  - what brought you back here?
  ans:
  - i had finished my master's, for one...... and no visa, no more visa.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - and i said to him,\\"i have no idea how to shoot a gun...... and i have no interest in firearms whatsoever.

- que:
  - the way that cop had pulled his gun out, and everything, right?
  ans:
  - so i canceled my demand for the gun...... and i called the police and tried to complain about that cop.

- que:
  - what happened with that?
  ans:
  - it was so much paperwork...... and then i got scared, with my shitty student visa...

- que:
  - thought you'd get deported?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - have you noticed?
  ans:
  - no, everybody seems pretty happy to me.

- que:
  - they're not happy?
  ans:
  - no, they are.

- que:
  - what about them?
  ans:
  - well, they're very nice.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, i guess they're not as...

- que:
  - horny?
  ans:
  - they're not as horny.

- que:
  - horny?
  ans:
  - wait, listen to me on this one.

- que:
  - have you ever spent time in eastern europe?
  ans:
  - eastern...

- que:
  - communist ideas?
  ans:
  - listen, i'm not...

- que:
  - nine years?
  ans:
  - no, that's impossible.

- que:
  - i do?
  ans:
  - i'd have to see you naked.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i know, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - voil.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - okay, come on.

- que:
  - did you think i was fat before?
  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - seriously, all right?
  ans:
  - you look beautiful.

- que:
  - do i look any different?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - like a gunshot wound?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - i like getting older, you know?
  ans:
  - life feels...

- que:
  - you were?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - could i have a drag of that?
  ans:
  - well, your book has been published.

- que:
  - are you enjoying every minute of it?
  ans:
  - not really.

- que:
  - not really?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you have another one of those?
  ans:
  - yes, of course.

- que:
  - what do you mean, exactly?
  ans:
  - i was working for this organization that helped villages in mexico.

- que:
  - i mean, i feel like i'm...... designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything, you know?
  ans:
  - it's like always trying to better my situation.

- que:
  - and then i think, to hell with it, right?
  ans:
  - desire's the fuel of life.

- que:
  - do you think it's true...... that if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i mean, it's healthy to desire, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it's what all those buddhist guys say, right?
  ans:
  - liberate yourself from desire, and you'il find...... you already have everything you need.

- que:
  - i like that we have those ever renewing desires, you know?
  ans:
  - maybe it's this sense of entitlement.

- que:
  - you know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes?
  ans:
  - it's okay to want things, as long as you aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

- que:
  - so, what, are you buddhist, or something?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - trappist?
  ans:
  - yeah, they're catholic.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i'd been doing some reading.

- que:
  - have you ever spent any time with monks or nuns?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - well, i expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't.

- que:
  - i want to be a better person,\\"you know?
  ans:
  - you can't escape.

- que:
  - it all comes down to that, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - that's why i really admire what you're doing.

- que:
  - sucking cock?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - wrong answer.

- que:
  - you know something?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna be on planes...... and in an airport for the next eight hours...

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - that's great.

- que:
  - do you want to?
  ans:
  - let's do that.

  - it's when everything's on sale in paris.

- que:
  - is this where we're going?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you ever in therapy?
  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - do i seem like i'm in therapy?
  ans:
  - i'm kidding.

- que:
  - my sex problems?
  ans:
  - i'm kidding.

- que:
  - that's a joke, right?
  ans:
  - no, we didn't.

- que:
  - was it in the cemetery?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - in the park?
  ans:
  - wait a minute, wait a minute.

- que:
  - in the park?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - are you messing with me?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - i mean, you're right, okay?
  ans:
  - sometimes i put things in drawers inside my head and forget about it.

- que:
  - what, so that night was, like, a sad memory for you?
  ans:
  - i didn't mean that night in particular.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, i thought i did.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - reading your book, maybe?
  ans:
  - no, but...

- que:
  - can i put that on a bumper sticker?
  ans:
  - if you wrote a book about our night, that's a good title.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - now that we've met again...... we can change our memory of that december 16.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - she was so obsessed with it that, later in life, you know...... i had this image in my head that this really happened.

- que:
  - could we?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - and what really surprised me is...... that i was dealing with life the same way i am now.

- que:
  - you believe that?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - the same?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so i'il be forever depressed no matter what great things happen?
  ans:
  - definitely.

- que:
  - no, come on, are you depressed now?
  ans:
  - no, no, i'm not depressed.

- que:
  - well, what do you want to do?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - do you believe in ghosts or spirits?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - okay, what about reincarnation?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - god?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - there we go.
  ans:
  - so then, astrology?

  - that makes sense, right?
  ans:
  - you're a scorpio, i'm a sag, we get along.

- que:
  - what is important?
  ans:
  - you know, every day's our last.

- que:
  - are you gonna commit suicide?
  ans:
  - it's almost not worth it.

- que:
  - what about us?
  ans:
  - no, what i mean is...... if we were both going to die tonight...

- que:
  - like the apocalypse was coming?
  ans:
  - no, that's too dramatic...

- que:
  - the environment?
  ans:
  - or...

- que:
  - what would you tell me?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - that's hard, huh?
  ans:
  - no, no, i'il do it.

- que:
  - why not do it right there on a bench?
  ans:
  - come here, come here, come here.

- que:
  - but why not?
  ans:
  - no, this example, this friend of mine, she was talking about...

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - totally.

- que:
  - what, more than women?
  ans:
  - definitely on that subject.

- que:
  - you think so?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - to please?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know.

- que:
  - what, written down, or out loud?
  ans:
  - yeah, mostly written down.

- que:
  - are you into s & m?
  ans:
  - no, but a good spanking once in a while doesn't hurt.

- que:
  - that kind of thing?
  ans:
  - yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

- que:
  - what, me?
  ans:
  - well, yeah.

- que:

- que:
  - what, right in the same spot?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - really crazy, right?
  ans:
  - now i know for sure.

- que:
  - so you'd come to a reading in paris...... and i could walk up to you and ask,\\"where the fuck were you?
  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - you think i'd be here today?
  ans:
  - i'm serious.

- que:
  - what were the chances of us ever meeting again?
  ans:
  - after that december, i'd say almost zero.

- que:
  - but we're not real anyway, right?
  ans:
  - we're just characters in that old lady's dream.

- que:
  - why weren't you there in vienna?
  ans:
  - i told you why.

- que:
  - you think so?
  ans:
  - i actually do.

- que:
  - what, like we hate each other now?
  ans:
  - you know, maybe we're...

- que:
  - why didn't we do that?
  ans:
  - because we were young and stupid.

- que:
  - do you think we still are?
  ans:
  - i guess when you're young you just believe...... there'il be many people you'il connect with.

- que:
  - that everything's fated?
  ans:
  - well, you know, the world might be less free than we think.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - when given these exact circumstances, that's what will happen every time.

- que:
  - days, even?
  ans:
  - things might have been different.

- que:
  - so, what is it like to be married?
  ans:
  - you haven't talked much about that.

- que:
  - i haven't?
  ans:
  - how weird.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we were sort of back together and she was pregnant...... so marriage.

- que:
  - what is she like?
  ans:
  - she's a great teacher, a good mom.

- que:
  - so you got married because men you admired were married?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - this idea of my best self, you know?
  ans:
  - and i wanted to pursue that...... even if it might have been overriding my honest self.

- que:
  - you know what i'm saying?
  ans:
  - in the moment, i remember thinking it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

- que:
  - i mean, what is love, right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration?
  ans:
  - and i...

- que:
  - you laughing at me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what monastery do monks have sex...?
  ans:
  - okay, you're right, i'm doing better than most monks.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're not that happy with your marriage.

- que:
  - how's she doing?
  ans:
  - she's a mess, but...

- que:
  - what reason is that?
  ans:
  - they all expected, after a few years of living together...... for the passion, that desire, to be the same.

- que:
  - and thank god...... we'd end up with aneurysms in that constant state of excitement, right?
  ans:
  - we'd do nothing at all with our lives.

- que:
  - would you have finished your book if you were fucking every five minutes?
  ans:
  - i might have welcomed the challenge, i mean...

- que:
  - that wouldn't make any sense, right?
  ans:
  - everything you're saying makes sense.

- que:
  - why don't we just give you a ride home?
  ans:
  - well, i can take the mtro.

- que:
  - monsieur, can...?
  ans:
  - it's not on the way.

- que:
  - you told him where you are and all that?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - he knows where he's going?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but this is better than the mtro, right?
  ans:
  - definitely.

- que:
  - is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's never around?
  ans:
  - yes, obviously i can't deal with the day to day life of a relationship.

- que:
  - it's not, right?
  ans:
  - you know, it's not even that.

- que:
  - it stirred shit up, you know?
  ans:
  - i don't feel things for people anymore.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - reality and love are almost contradictory for me.

- que:
  - but what does it mean, the right man, the love of your life?
  ans:
  - the concept is absurd.

- que:
  - can i talk?
  ans:
  - i guess i've been heartbroken too many times and then i recovered.

- que:
  - i'm so glad you didn't forget about me, okay?
  ans:
  - no, i didn't.

- que:
  - and it pisses me off, okay?
  ans:
  - you come here to paris, all romantic, and married.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - screw you.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - i don't feel pain or excitement, i'm not even bitter, i'm just...
  ans:
  - they do?

- que:
  - you think you're the one dying inside?
  ans:
  - my life is 24/ 7 bad.

- que:
  - did the candles help?
  ans:
  - hell, no.

- que:
  - but then, there's no joy or laughter in my home, you know?
  ans:
  - i don't want him growing up in that.

- que:
  - no laughter?
  ans:
  - that's terrible.

- que:
  - what dreams?
  ans:
  - and i wake up with the fucking sweats.

- que:
  - and i touch you anyway...... right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft that i wake up in sobs, all right?
  ans:
  - my wife is there looking at me, and i feel i'm a million miles from her.

- que:
  - why are you telling me all this?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - this is where you live?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so you're just relieved that i'm in even more deep shit than you are?
  ans:
  - yes, you've made me feel better.

- que:
  - you think so?
  ans:
  - yeah...... a few antidepressants, you know, you'il do great.

- que:
  - you ready?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - how long have you been here?
  ans:
  - four years.

- que:
  - is it all true about your dreams...... or did you say that to hopefully get in my pants?
  ans:
  - i said that to get in your pants.

- que:
  - does it work?
  ans:
  - you know.

- que:
  - you know what i love about this cat?
  ans:
  - every morning i bring him to the courtyard...... and every single morning he looks at everything like it was the first time.

  ans:

- que:
  - which is the best way?
  ans:
  - what i'm telling you is as good as any, better than most.

- que:
  - you see, joey?
  ans:
  - now look.

- que:
  - why do you always have to spoil everything?
  ans:
  - a gun is a tool, no better or worse than any other tool, an axe, a shovel, or anything.

  ans:
  - what's all the shooting about?

  - you've made things hard for us, and we're in the right.

- que:
  - you in the right?
  ans:
  - when i came to this country, you weren't much older than your boy.

- que:
  - the men that did the work and ran the risks have no rights?
  ans:
  - i take you for a fair man, starrett.

- que:
  - what about the others?
  ans:
  - shane knows he can work for me.

- que:
  - you don't give a man much choice.
  ans:
  - the other homesteaders?

- que:
  - would you like to go partners with me?
  ans:
  - i don't want trouble with your father.

- que:
  - how about it, son?
  ans:
  - come here, joey.

- que:
  - what do you make of him?
  ans:
  - he's no cow puncher.

- que:
  - why don't we just gun him and get on with it?
  ans:
  - one's run already.

- que:
  - where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - to get a whiskey.

- que:
  - anything wrong with that?
  ans:
  - it's just funny.

- que:
  - or would you know?
  ans:
  - i'm saying that\\"stonewall\\"jackson was trash himself.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - you're dealing with me, ryker.

  ans:
  - not quite yet.

  ans:
  - no, it ain't, shane.

- que:
  - what's that mean to you, shane?
  ans:
  - i've heard about you.

  - what have you heard, shane?
  ans:
  - i've heard that you're a low down, yankee liar.

  ans:
  - it's, uh, kind of a baldy, pinky, whitey thingy.

- que:
  - you wanna break his heart?
  ans:
  - but it doesn't belong to him.

- que:
  - who's to say it belongs to you?
  ans:
  - i'm not leaving without the bag.

- que:
  - and what have we here?
  ans:
  - well, uh, we're in a negotiation... with this naked, pink individual.

- que:
  - so, will this little pink\\"lunchness\"... fulfill his destiny, nourishmentally speaking?
  ans:
  - please let me out.

- que:
  - can you imagine?
  ans:
  - esme hoggett, fugly floom.

- que:
  - did you get that?
  ans:
  - approximately five minutes ago something that looked like a pig exited this establishment.

- que:
  - where did he go?
  ans:
  - not you.

- que:
  - and the animals had told him if all went well... there would be big rewards.
  ans:
  - y you know  what's in the bag?

- que:
  - sir, i gotta get going now.
  ans:
  - uh, h hey, so, when do i get paid?

- que:
  - just tell me.
  ans:
  - how do i collect my reward?

- que:
  - was there ever such a thing?
  ans:
  - oh, little pink thingy, this is the city.

- que:
  - as bob always says what do you say, bob?
  ans:
  - it's all illusory it's ill, and it's for losers.

- que:
  - get my drift?
  ans:
  - i'm not a pork pie.

- que:
  - where was the boss's wife?
  ans:
  - i couldn't wake him.

- que:
  - thelonius?
  ans:
  - easy, let him be.

- que:
  - hey, dogs, you got any edibles, any nibbly dibblies?
  ans:
  - we got a carpet here with some nice spaghetti stains.

- que:
  - but we can't keep licking the carpet, can we, alan?
  ans:
  - no, nigel.

- que:
  - without a human?
  ans:
  - could be kinda dangerous, you know, in a lethally sort of way.

- que:
  - what can you do?
  ans:
  - you don't even have any hands.

- que:
  - what can i do?
  ans:
  - uh, lots.

- que:
  - you do?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - border leicester or scottish blackface?
  ans:
  - pit bull and a doberman pinscher.

- que:
  - uh, where do you want me to herd them?
  ans:
  - that's up to you.

- que:
  - uh, anybody else?
  ans:
  - i have been cruelly cast out and have nowhere to go.

- que:
  - oh, b but how?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - where's your human?
  ans:
  - my humans belong to someone else now.

- que:
  - uh, could that be food?
  ans:
  - oh, have mercy.

- que:
  - anybody else?
  ans:
  - fine by moi.

- que:
  - anybody else else?
  ans:
  - it's still just a pig.

- que:
  - they'il soil willy nilly, won't they, alan?
  ans:
  - willy nilly, nigel.

- que:
  - should i have let you drown?
  ans:
  - most would have.

- que:
  - here.
  ans:
  - will someone slap the dog?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - mmm.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - um...

- que:
  - who's like us?
  ans:
  - you look different.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - okay, you're gonna be all right.

- que:
  - you got him?
  ans:
  - easy.

- que:
  - you got him?
  ans:
  - reel him in.

- que:
  - cats?
  ans:
  - no, that does it.

- que:
  - someone help me.
  ans:
  - think we can get out of here without either one of us getting hurt?

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - get it out of here.

- que:
  - a are you okay?
  ans:
  - just flip me over.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - it's all in the hooter.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - the olfactory instrument.

- que:
  - would you help me off with this, please?
  ans:
  - oh, boy.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i, l i'm not dressed.

- que:
  - mr. thelonius?
  ans:
  - time to go.

- que:
  - when is something nice gonna happen to me?
  ans:
  - pig.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i thought i could make a place where we would all be okay.

- que:
  - but how can you do that here?
  ans:
  - this used to be a lovely neighborhood.

- que:
  - clothes.
  ans:
  - why couldn't they just leave us be?

- que:
  - where are our animals?
  ans:
  - i'm not going across there.

- que:
  - yeah, for my babies?
  ans:
  - there is a place i know, but it's ever so far away.

- que:
  - how do we get there?
  ans:
  - well, first we have to find my human.

- que:
  - darling?
  ans:
  - there you are.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - quietly.

- que:
  - mrs. willis.   any pain?
  ans:
  - no, very little.

- que:
  - what kind?
  ans:
  - pig, cats, dogs, monkeys, that sort of thing.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - you're comin 'with me, porky.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i think i dropped a baby.

- que:
  - what do you mean, you dropped a baby?
  ans:
  - i must have dropped the other baby.

- que:
  - give me your snarl.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - but, dad, do we have to?
  ans:
  - we are replicators.

- que:
  - you would do that?
  ans:
  - they won t leave me.

- que:
  - who's replacing you sir?
  ans:
  - her name is doctor elizabeth weir.

- que:
  - a civilian?
  ans:
  - she's an expert in international politics.

- que:
  - are you saying the lost city of the ancients is here?
  ans:
  - the city we've been looking for is under the ice at antarctica.

- que:
  - so in the meanwhile, jack just stays frozen in a stasis pod down there?
  ans:
  - it's not that we can't use it.

- que:
  - what about colonel o'neill?
  ans:
  - look, i know what he means to the three of you.

- que:
  - what do you suggest we do?
  ans:
  - you're aware of how we helped the asgard trap the replicators in a time dilation field on the planet halla.

- que:
  - that was a couple of years ago, right?
  ans:
  - basically we know that, that trap is only going to hold them for so long.

- que:
  - isn't the planet you're talking about, in another galaxy?
  ans:
  - othalla.

- que:
  - and back?
  ans:
  - that might be a problem.

- que:
  - if you get there and it turns out, you can't contact the asgard?
  ans:
  - we're willing to take the risk.

- que:
  - for what reason?
  ans:
  - colonel o'neill was able to fend off anubis 'fleet, using the weapons from the ancients outpost.

- que:
  - what can i do for you major?
  ans:
  - i want you to reconsider my request.

- que:
  - can i get you anything?
  ans:
  - i packed lots of turkey, i know that's your favourite.

- que:
  - have you been able to determine how o'neill modified the engines?
  ans:
  - no, i'm just taking a break.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, have i been ignoring you?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - concerning what subject?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how's ryac?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - are you still keeping in touch with ishta?
  ans:
  - indeed.

- que:
  - bra'tac?
  ans:
  - bra'tac is well.

- que:
  - how is pete shanahan?
  ans:
  - he's fine.

- que:
  - is all not well, between the two of you?
  ans:
  - no, everything is great.

- que:
  - we were attacked from space by an armada of alien ships, if that doesn't get us past our distrust of each other, what will?
  ans:
  - you forget that those alien ships were destroyed by a single weapon.

- que:
  - it's goa'uld.
  ans:
  - unauthorized offworld activation!

- que:
  - what does it say?
  ans:
  - it's from one of the system lords, camulus, celtic god of war.

- que:
  - woow yeah, of course, woow?
  ans:
  - sorry, it say's he wants to arrange a meeting for the purpose of negotiating a treaty.

- que:
  - a goa'uld wants to arrange a treaty with us?
  ans:
  - not just one goa'uld.

- que:
  - should we not be able to see the planet?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you sure that this is an accurate translation of the message?
  ans:
  - pretty much.

- que:
  - are we that far off course?
  ans:
  - no, we came out of hyperspace, right where we were supposed to.

- que:
  - you don't think i can handle it?
  ans:
  - i didn't say that, but if i may, you don't sound all that confident.

- que:
  - why should i be nervous?
  ans:
  - seems like an average day at the united nations.

- que:
  - so what can you tell me?
  ans:
  - the high council of the system lords, is a rather flimsy coalition of the most powerful goa'ulds in the galaxy.

- que:
  - so the goa'uld have agreed to our terms, for their travel here?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - yu?
  ans:
  - don't.

- que:
  - well why would they choose him as a representative?
  ans:
  - the others may be doing a good job of covering for him.

- que:
  - that's the bright side?
  ans:
  - more of a slightly less, dark side.

- que:
  - what is your mission?
  ans:
  - the mass of replicator blocks have begun moving away from the event horizon.

- que:
  - how is that possible?
  ans:
  - they have the time dilation device.

- que:
  - into what?
  ans:
  - a ship.

- que:
  - heard anything from teal'c and sam?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i generally find it helps so much.

- que:
  - have you ever seen anything like it?
  ans:
  - no, and it is doubtful my ships weapons will be effective against it.

- que:
  - can you jump into hyperspace?
  ans:
  - we must clear the gravitational distortion from above the black hole first.

- que:
  - can it penetrate your shields?
  ans:
  - it is more than likely.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - the damage is minimal.

- que:
  - can you use the shields to prevent decompression in those sections?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - orac?
  ans:
  - unspeakable.

- que:
  - is she in your presence?
  ans:
  - i did not do it.

- que:
  - can you follow?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - if ba'al defeats us, how long do you think it will be before he turns his attention to you?
  ans:
  - if he does he'il suffer the same fate as anubis.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - we could not help but notice that the asgard did not come to your aid, when anubis threatened your planet.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - that's odd, because we talk to them all the time.

- que:
  - do you know it's destination?
  ans:
  - before you destroyed them, the replicators managed to access the shp computer.

- que:
  - what is your reasoning?
  ans:
  - orilla is rich in neutronium.

- que:
  - how many planets are protected under this treaty?
  ans:
  - 26.

- que:
  - and what good is it if the asgard aren't actually available to protect anything?
  ans:
  - at one time they were.

- que:
  - too dramatic?
  ans:
  - at this point, not for me.

- que:
  - how can we stop them?
  ans:
  - my ships weapons will not function in hyperspace, much like the shields.

- que:
  - you think you deserve better?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what exactly are you offering?
  ans:
  - hyperdrive engines.

- que:
  - i think the real question is, how many ships do you have?
  ans:
  - i mean, if we're gonna enforce this treaty ourselves, we need to build enough ships to match any fleet that would oppose us.

- que:
  - we will?
  ans:
  - in exchange, we want ba'al's territory.

- que:
  - well that's the way it works right?
  ans:
  - when one system lord kills another, he takes over his armies, his fleet, his planets.

- que:
  - if we're gonna be the one's who destroy ba'al for you, why should we settle for anything less?
  ans:
  - preposterous.

- que:
  - always bet big when bluffing?
  ans:
  - i just didn't know you wanted to become a system lord.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you can't change what happened.

- que:
  - is this making you feel better?
  ans:
  - i never intended to abandon you.

- que:
  - progress?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what is the meaning of this?
  ans:
  - sending ships here to attack us, is an act of war, and a foolish one at that, given what our defenses are capable of.

- que:
  - so, what can we do?
  ans:
  - thor believes the ancients knowledge stored in o'neills mind, may be the key to defeating the replicators once and for all.

- que:
  - where's sam?
  ans:
  - she was captured by the replicators.

- que:
  - is something wrong?
  ans:
  - yes, everything.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - this.

- que:
  - where the hell is here?
  ans:
  - that was good.

- que:
  - you don't what?
  ans:
  - think this is real.

- que:
  - you hungry?
  ans:
  - i'm starving.

- que:
  - you've had a bad one ok?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - did that feel real?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - pancakes, or do i have to call the doctor?
  ans:
  - i'm kind of hungry.

- que:
  - what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - i'm going to merge o'neill's mind, with the ships computer.

- que:
  - to do that, you're going to have to defrost him first, right?
  ans:
  - i bring this up, because he was near death when we froze him.

- que:
  - well, can't you just save him, like the last time this happened?
  ans:
  - just wipe the ancient knowledge from his mind.

- que:
  - can't you just extract the ancient information into the ships computer?
  ans:
  - then we can all benefit from it.

- que:
  - you requested to see me?
  ans:
  - you must let us go.

- que:
  - what would you have me do?
  ans:
  - free us to fight.

- que:
  - jack?
  ans:
  - o'neill.

- que:
  - hey guys.
  ans:
  - can you hear us?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the name of thor's ship is daniel jackson.

- que:
  - i can pretty much anything i want, cant i?
  ans:
  - it's a little weird.

- que:
  - can you help with the replicators?
  ans:
  - that is definitely not pete.

- que:
  - why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - because i love you.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i am unsure.

- que:
  - jack, can you hear me?
  ans:
  - i must revive him now.

- que:
  - what's the last thing you remember?
  ans:
  - getting my head sucked, by one of those dang ancient head suckers.

- que:
  - what's with the hair?
  ans:
  - o'neill.

- que:
  - you got an aspirin?
  ans:
  - you should feel better momentarily and your memory will slowly return.

- que:
  - teal'c, what's with the hair?
  ans:
  - the specifications for the device you created, remain in the computer.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - we don't know, but you made it.

- que:
  - were you able to procure means of fighting the replicators?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - can you scan the planet for life signs?
  ans:
  - we already have.

- que:
  - can you hear me?
  ans:
  - we have lost contact...

- que:
  - that i would just accept it?
  ans:
  - if it was something you wanted badly enough, in your mind.

- que:
  - is that why you tortured me for so long?
  ans:
  - so i would want this as an alternative.

- que:
  - most intriguing.
  ans:
  - why do you think i hated you so much for what you did to me?

- que:
  - can you make it work?
  ans:
  - to be honest, i am unsure of exactly what it is.

- que:
  - what have you to report?
  ans:
  - we have located what appears to be the remains of a human form replicator, floating in space.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - i am going to transport it aboard.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we must learn the location of the human form controlling the replicators on the planet.

- que:
  - anybody recognise him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is it dead?
  ans:
  - hopefully, not completely.

- que:
  - and if he wakes up, can this pod get a hold of him?
  ans:
  - probably not.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - replicator communication data.

- que:
  - sam.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - can you pinpoint her location?
  ans:
  - she is in a small replicator structure on the planet.

- que:
  - i mean we can use this thing to whack the rest of those bugs?
  ans:
  - even better, o'neill.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - this could be very bad.

- que:
  - what is happening o'neill?
  ans:
  - we must leave.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - they've found a means to fight us.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - the one you call o'neill.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - so many of us are left in the city.

- que:
  - you know why my friends won't stop, just to save me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how are you feeling?
  ans:
  - not bad.

- que:
  - do you know what they're having?
  ans:
  - i don't think i've had the chance to personally thank you yet.

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - you risk your life over and over, and ask for nothing in return.

- que:
  - are you going somewhere?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, the president has asked me to supervise the research of the ancient outpost.

- que:
  - do we know this shrub?
  ans:
  - well you know him rather well.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - yeah, you.

- que:
  - i do?
  ans:
  - on the flip side of the coin, there's the fact that no one knows how this place should be run, better than you.

- que:
  - am i supposed to hold my breath?
  ans:
  - the poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - they call themselves the trust.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - were you detecting any signs of gate activity?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - did anyone approach the gate at any time?
  ans:
  - no, sergeant, i think it's safe to say there was nothing you could have done.

- que:
  - you were getting coffee?
  ans:
  - um... we... it...

- que:
  - is it just me or does that look like an asgard beam?
  ans:
  - it does... which makes no sense.

- que:
  - why would they take our gate?
  ans:
  - usually they ask nicely before they ignore us and do whatever they damn well please.

- que:
  - didn't the asgard install beam technology as well as a hyperdrive?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's in the hangar.

- que:
  - you think ba'al stole our gate?
  ans:
  - to be honest, right now i don't know what to think.

- que:
  - is teal'c still on p4s 161?
  ans:
  - yeah, his meeting with the rebel jaffa leaders should be over by now.

- que:
  - what is the situation?
  ans:
  - we've been out of contact with earth for seven hours now.

- que:
  - find anything?
  ans:
  - yeah, as a matter of fact i have.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but i checked the time code and this corresponds with the exact moment that the sensors began recording the anomaly.

- que:
  - you think it's the trust?
  ans:
  - well, they've been busy lately.

- que:
  - you think the anomaly was a locator beacon?
  ans:
  - yeah, which hartkins placed directly on the gate.

- que:
  - so my stamp collection is safe how does that help us find the gate?
  ans:
  - well, if they wanna keep using the beam, they'il have to keep using the beacons.

- que:
  - what has happened here?
  ans:
  - when i arrived, they were all dead.

- que:
  - all?
  ans:
  - i will show you.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - methylphosphonothioic acid.

- que:
  - which is?
  ans:
  - nerve gas.

- que:
  - what would the ex nld be doing stockpiling this stuff?
  ans:
  - it's too late.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - we managed to identify the liquid we found in the warehouse.

- que:
  - i believe you've been briefed on our situation?
  ans:
  - yes, i have.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - right where we left it.

- que:
  - why would they suddenly decide to use it now?
  ans:
  - perhaps the failure of the alliance convinced them that there is no other way.

- que:
  - without sympathetic warriors in zaren's ranks, how do you plan to avoid being captured?
  ans:
  - we do not.

- que:
  - you realise the second you walk through that gate, you're on your own?
  ans:
  - understood.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - you were followed.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - we've got an uninvited guest.

- que:
  - are you certain?
  ans:
  - i am.

- que:
  - lord ba'al will be most pleased, will he not?
  ans:
  - yes, of course.

- que:
  - and we can also choose to ignore your two million dollar cayman island account.
  ans:
  - i'm gonna ask you again, where's colonel carter?

- que:
  - so if i help you, i can keep the money?
  ans:
  - we can come to an arrangement.

- que:
  - my lord?
  ans:
  - we must speak with you.

- que:
  - you said colonel carter was missing?
  ans:
  - well, she's probably on the ship.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - one day i was in the lab working on the adapter.

- que:
  - can you get the wrist device to work again?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - we're in a polar orbit around the moon...

- que:
  - you realise you're killing millions of innocent jaffa?
  ans:
  - spare me, colonel.

- que:
  - what about the rebel jaffa?
  ans:
  - they're growing in numbers every day.

- que:
  - what's the next target?
  ans:
  - p3s 114.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - we know about the attacks.

- que:
  - what attacks?
  ans:
  - the tok'ra have been using the symbiont poison against the goa'uld.

- que:
  - how do you explain this?
  ans:
  - i cannot.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - my lord.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - a weapon was fired through the gate.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you know as much about the current tactical and strategic positions of the different system lords as anyone on earth.

- que:
  - are we going for p5r 357 or not?
  ans:
  - go to the next one on the list.

- que:
  - tell me again why i should agree to this?
  ans:
  - and if there are ten armed goons when you get there, you're the only that's gonna... get...

- que:
  - better ideas?
  ans:
  - look, daniel, just because i don't have a better idea is no reason to do anything.

- que:
  - they noticed us yet?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - what about the hyperdrive?
  ans:
  - still no signal from doctor jackson.

- que:
  - any chance there's more of them on board?
  ans:
  - it only lets one person up at a time.

- que:
  - what about them?
  ans:
  - cargo hold, respond.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - she's bringing the hyperdrive on line.

- que:
  - can you disable the ship without destroying it?
  ans:
  - i cannot give you any guarantees.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - locator beacon, sir.

- que:
  - what of the tok'ra poison?
  ans:
  - well, they left most of it behind, but they still have enough to wipe out at least half a dozen goa'uld worlds.

- que:
  - rescue 3, jessie, do you see him yet?
  ans:
  - patience, my love.

- que:

  ans:

  ans:
  - don't tempt me.

- que:
  - is it really 4, 000?
  ans:
  - about that.

  ans:

- que:
  - then how come i haven't had a girlfriend in four years?
  ans:
  - i can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.

- que:
  - what kind of a question is that?

- que:
  - are you into girls with big tits?

  ans:

- que:
  - first of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
  ans:
  - it's a found object.

- que:
  - but what can you tell us about it... in regard to your artistic intent?
  ans:
  - well, i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - the blond guy over there.

- que:
  - you guys up for some reggae tonight?
  ans:
  - ok, you're right.

  ans:
  - for nineteen years.

- que:
  - were you a fry cook or something?
  ans:
  - nothing so glamorous, actually.

- que:
  - are you saying that things were better back then... even though there was stuff like this?
  ans:
  - i suppose things are better now, but...

  ans:
  - i promise i'il take good care of it.

- que:
  - don't you trust me, seymour?

- que:
  - can you tell us why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, no, it's more of a found art object.

- que:
  - how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
  ans:
  - it's complicated.

- que:
  - and how do you think an image like this... helps us to see that?

  ans:
  - i can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.

- que:
  - what kind of a question is that?

- que:

  ans:
  - it's a found object.

- que:
  - but what can you tell us about it... in regard to your artistic intent?
  ans:
  - well, i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - the blond guy over there.

- que:
  - you guys up for some reggae tonight?
  ans:
  - ok, you're right.

- que:
  - you work for cook's chicken?
  ans:
  - for nineteen years.

- que:
  - were you a fry cook or something?
  ans:
  - nothing so glamorous, actually.

- que:
  - are you saying that things were better back then... even though there was stuff like this?
  ans:
  - i suppose things are better now, but...

- que:
  - for what?
  ans:
  - i promise i'il take good care of it.

- que:
  - don't you trust me, seymour?
  ans:

- que:
  - can you tell us why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:

  ans:
  - well, no, it's more of a found art object.

- que:
  - how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
  ans:
  - it's complicated.

- que:
  - and how do you think an image like this... helps us to see that?

- que:
  - why aren't you screaming at me now?
  ans:
  - cause i'm happy.

- que:
  - you're happy to get a fine?

  - no, because caitlin came to see me.

- que:
  - what'd she say?
  ans:
  - she's not marrying that guy.

- que:
  - what happened to\\"title dictates behavior\"?
  ans:

- que:
  - why don't you go join her?
  ans:
  - make a little bathroom bam bam.

- que:
  - how did you get here so fast?
  ans:
  - i left like an hour ago.

- que:
  - do you always talk this weird after you violate a woman?
  ans:
  - maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - when you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything.

- que:
  - am i missing something here?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - was it you?
  ans:
  - i was up here the whole time.

- que:
  - oh, so we didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who went back there?
  ans:
  - nobody.

- que:
  - call the police.
  ans:
  - are you sure there was someone back there?

- que:
  - she said she did all the work.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:

  ans:
  - nobody. it was closed.

- que:

  - go ahead.

- que:
  - did he have the adult magazine when he came in?
  ans:
  - uh, no.

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - i was born?
  ans:
  - you should shit or get off the pot.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i'm talking about this thing you have, this inability to improve your station in life.

- que:
  - all right, if you hate this job and the people... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don't you quit?
  ans:
  - like it's that easy. it is.

- que:
  - so what's stoppin 'you?
  ans:
  - leave me alone.

- que:
  - oh, you're comfortable, right?
  ans:
  - this is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.

- que:
  - things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin.
  ans:
  - am i right or what?

- que:
  - oh, what, the dead guy?
  ans:
  - she'il get over fuckin 'a dead guy.

- que:
  - yes, some of the things you're saying are true\"?
  ans:
  - that's the way things are.

- que:
  - jesus, will you leave me alone?
  ans:
  - hell, yes, whatever that means.

- que:
  - you get high?
  ans:
  - i should start.

- que:
  - wanna come to this party tonight?
  ans:
  - there's gonna be some pussy there.

- que:

- que:
  - how's your eye?

  - the swelling's not that bad, but the f. d. s. stings.

- que:
  - why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
  ans:
  - i thought i was doing you a favor.

- que:
  - no, really.
  ans:
  - why do you say that?

- que:
  - what don't you do?
  ans:
  - sometimes i think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.

- que:
  - what time did you get to work today?
  ans:
  - like 10:00, or ten after.

- que:
  - i'm the source of all your misery.
  ans:

  ans:
  - like it's that easy. it is.

- que:
  - so what's stoppin 'you?
  ans:
  - leave me alone.

- que:
  - why aren't you screaming at me now?
  ans:
  - cause i'm happy.

  ans:
  - she's not marrying that guy.

- que:
  - what happened to\\"title dictates behavior\"?
  ans:

  - like what?
  ans:
  - when you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything.

- que:
  - am i missing something here?
  ans:
  - okay.

  ans:
  - 4:00, i think.

  - i was born?
  ans:
  - you should shit or get off the pot.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i'm talking about this thing you have, this inability to improve your station in life.

- que:
  - all right, if you hate this job and the people... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don't you quit?
  ans:
  - like it's that easy. it is.

- que:
  - so what's stoppin 'you?
  ans:
  - leave me alone.

- que:
  - oh, you're comfortable, right?
  ans:
  - this is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.

  - things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin.
  ans:
  - am i right or what?

- que:
  - oh, what, the dead guy?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah, veronica.

- que:

- que:
  - why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
  ans:
  - i thought i was doing you a favor.

- que:
  - no, really.
  ans:
  - why do you say that?

- que:
  - what don't you do?
  ans:
  - sometimes i think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.

- que:
  - what time did you get to work today?
  ans:
  - like 10:00, or ten after.

- que:
  - i'm the source of all your misery.
  ans:
  - i mean, what's your encore?

  - do you need help with those?
  ans:
  - ah, no more steps.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - when a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - after shang tsung.

- que:
  - remember what rayden said?
  ans:
  - he didn't say anything to me.

- que:
  - how many times must i tell you?

- que:
  - are you out of your mind?
  ans:
  - sonya...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - see, me...

- que:
  - then he freezes this guy, right?
  ans:
  - and then he explodes.

- que:
  - what i want to know... if this shang tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
  ans:

  ans:
  - look at him.

- que:
  - now, when do i get paid?
  ans:
  - after you've fought the girl.

- que:
  - to what do we owe the honor of your visit, shang tsung?
  ans:
  - to warn you kung lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.

- que:
  - why should i worry about her?
  ans:
  - princess kitana is 10, 000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of outworld.

  ans:

- que:
  - did you miss me?
  ans:

- que:
  - you used it to knife your mother in the back?
  ans:
  - it put a big smile on your partner, though.

- que:
  - does it hurt, baby?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - why do you care if i win?
  ans:
  - to win your next match, use the element which brings life.

- que:
  - water.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - ls it time?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how can we possibly beat something like that?
  ans:
  - good question.

- que:
  - so, who says we're afraid?
  ans:
  - you must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.

- que:
  - what about me?
  ans:
  - oh, you.

- que:
  - why can't you?
  ans:
  - i tried.

- que:
  - challenging goro, eh?
  ans:
  - you weren't supposed to fight him now.

- que:
  - are you that eager to die?
  ans:

- que:
  - so what's the problem?
  ans:
  - as you wish.

- que:
  - how do you say?
  ans:

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - reptile.

- que:
  - what happened here?
  ans:
  - the same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.

- que:
  - how can i stop this from happening in my world?
  ans:
  - lf i did not believe in you...

- que:
  - will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our emperor?
  ans:
  - ln his great wisdom, he knows that mortal kombat... cannot be won by treachery.

- que:
  - how dare you speak to me of treachery?
  ans:
  - your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the realm of earth.

  - why would you want to cuff me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why take her on an airplane with no means of escape?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - no.

- que:

  - you're judging me?
  ans:
  - that's a good one.

- que:
  - you're going to point a finger at me, the guy that you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
  ans:
  - you're right.

- que:
  - so, why did you let him go?
  ans:
  - it's complicated, dad.

- que:
  - every woman has the exact love life she wants.
  ans:
  - it probably wouldn't have worked out anyway, huh?

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i agree with him.

- que:
  - is he the guy for you?
  ans:
  - then go and get him.

- que:
  - are you sure this isn't a sin?
  ans:
  - i was pretty sure what we were doing wasn't a sin, but not sure enough to give dean what he really needed.

- que:
  - i mean, sure, jesus could restore my physical and spiritual virginity, especially if i lost it to some rapist, but... who wants that?
  ans:
  - i'm saving myself until marriage, and i'il use force if necessary.

- que:
  - what's all that about restoring your virginity?
  ans:
  - i mean, physically, you're a virgin once.

- que:
  - sure, it was a radical step, but why else had jesus directed me to the gun range?

  - your summer, how was it?

  ans:
  - a lot of temptations over the summer.

- que:
  - her actions are such a cry for help.
  ans:
  - who wants to recommit themselves to the lord?

- que:
  - she may not know this now, but she is like she's like that much closer to accepting jesus in her heart, right?
  ans:
  - i think that's why god has missionaries like patrick to spread his word.

- que:
  - you're mary, right?
  ans:
  - here's your board.

- que:
  - isn't she great?
  ans:
  - she knows just how to compliment my vocal stylings without overpowering them.

- que:
  - so, like, what part of the world has the worst heathens?
  ans:
  - cause i'm so interested in that.

  ans:
  - i'm just a kentucky gal who loves watching thoroughbreds race at the top of their game.

- que:
  - mr. walsh?
  ans:
  - well, there goes the great nolan walsh, everyone.

  - which is what you are.
  ans:
  - what did you just call me?

- que:
  - you didn't really think you were a horse, did you?
  ans:
  - but i am a horse.

  - a zebra?
  ans:
  - i thought i was a racehorse.

- que:
  - why didn't anyone tell me?
  ans:

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - at least she would've tried to understand.

- que:
  - what brings you out here?
  ans:
  - i got a hunch about your zebra.

- que:
  - twenty three seconds a quarter mile?
  ans:
  - he didn't finish...... but i got him between the quarter pole and the half mile pole.

- que:
  - and even if i could, i mean...... you got the $5000 entrance fee?
  ans:
  - we miss you down at the track.

- que:
  - is he always like this?
  ans:
  - worse.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - why don't you come on out here.

- que:
  - what?

  - i don't ride him.

- que:
  - franny?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - how did you know?
  ans:
  - if you build it, they will come.

- que:
  - why bother?
  ans:
  - i don't understand this.

- que:
  - isn't this what he wanted?
  ans:
  - this is exactly why i never had kids.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - get off my back.

- que:
  - run into any trees lately?
  ans:
  - oh, great.

- que:
  - what's going on with you?
  ans:
  - that doesn't sound like the attitude of a racehorse.

- que:
  - zebra?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - why didn't you say anything?
  ans:
  - because i don't care that you're not a racehorse.

- que:
  - hey, what's your problem?
  ans:
  - i'm not a racehorse.

- que:
  - anyone with a fire in their heart.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - what do you know, you little nobody?
  ans:
  - you never raced.

- que:
  - what's he ever done?
  ans:
  - let me tell you something.

- que:
  - and that's it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - and who else?
  ans:
  - tucker.

- que:
  - how come he never said anything?
  ans:
  - because to him...... actions speak louder than words.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - you're a horse with stripes who needs an attitude adjustment.

- que:
  - tucker, you don't really think i have what it takes, do you?
  ans:
  - now listen to me, kid.

- que:
  - you just keep running, okay?
  ans:
  - and let the chief worry about the gate.

- que:
  - now what?
  ans:
  - now you give it all you got.

- que:
  - well, tomorrow's the big day, kid.
  ans:
  - oh, god, what is that?

- que:
  - do you think i'm ready?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - you know what i used to tell my racers?
  ans:
  - don't look back, leave it all on the track.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - kid, when the time is right, you'il know.

- que:
  - where you think you going?
  ans:
  - you have a big day tomorrow.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i was hoping you'd come by.

- que:
  - the things i said the other day?
  ans:
  - how lucky you are.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes.

- que:

  ans:
  - goose, go get him some water.

- que:
  - you get my point?
  ans:
  - i'il do my best, dad.

- que:
  - how did you get in here?
  ans:
  - say your prayers, pelican.

- que:
  - can i get a little help here?
  ans:
  - tucker, get sandy.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don't want to be a racehorse.

- que:
  - what are we gonna do?
  ans:
  - we're gonna keep looking.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - he looks okay to me.

- que:
  - what were we talking about?
  ans:
  - i hate my life.

- que:
  - you forgive your old man?
  ans:
  - daddy, you're not old.

- que:
  - can a zebra...?
  ans:
  - sentimental favorite, stripes...... can beat trenton's pride.

- que:
  - beautiful day, huh?
  ans:
  - it would be if you weren't working so hard to ruin my race day...... with that glorified donkey of yours.

- que:
  - you wanna make this more interesting?
  ans:
  - i'm just asking.

- que:
  - would you shut up?
  ans:
  - tucker says to hug the rail and make your move at the turn.

- que:
  - stripes seems to be running out of steam.
  ans:
  - how does the rail taste?

- que:
  - had enough, boy?
  ans:
  - trenton's pride is going strongly up there amongst the leading line.

- que:
  - hey, stripey.
  ans:
  - do you copy, scuzz?

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - my father was wrong about you.

- que:
  - we left it all on the track, didn't we?

- que:
  - zebra?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - why didn't you say anything?
  ans:
  - because i don't care that you're not a racehorse.

  ans:
  - i'm not a racehorse.

- que:

- que:
  - and who else?
  ans:

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:
  - you're a horse with stripes who needs an attitude adjustment.

- que:
  - tucker, you don't really think i have what it takes, do you?
  ans:

- que:
  - you wanna make this more interesting?
  ans:
  - i'm just asking.

- que:
  - would you shut up?
  ans:
  - tucker says to hug the rail and make your move at the turn.

- que:
  - stripes seems to be running out of steam.
  ans:
  - how does the rail taste?

- que:
  - had enough, boy?
  ans:
  - trenton's pride is going strongly up there amongst the leading line.

  - and if they come to take you again?
  ans:
  - then i shall go and see the king in person... and not rot in the cardinal's jail.

- que:
  - porthos, who is this pretty young thing?
  ans:
  - he's a bit tender for you, josephine.

- que:
  - is that not right, aramis?
  ans:
  - perhaps later.

- que:
  - you both know her?
  ans:
  - yes.

  ans:
  - oh, a man has to fight with someone.

- que:

  - have you got dung in your ears?

- que:
  - i would not fight a drunken musketeer... so i'm unfit to drink with?
  ans:
  - athos was... testing you.

- que:
  - testing me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you've seen many ugly naked women?
  ans:
  - that's not what i meant.

- que:
  - are you standing up?
  ans:
  - you can turn around now.

- que:
  - are there, uh, any on my back?
  ans:
  - a few.

- que:
  - and you feel no need to be when insects are involved?
  ans:
  - my mother came from spain with the queen.

- que:
  - but it will not always be so, will it, d'artagnan?
  ans:
  - that must be fascinating work.

- que:
  - is that true, bonacieux?
  ans:
  - if bonacieux went that way, we should be going this way.

- que:
  - you consider this the test of a man?
  ans:
  - uh, more bread.

- que:
  - does he mean you or me?
  ans:
  - i thought i was the baker.

- que:
  - you think that came from a croissant?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:

  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i will stay.

- que:
  - your royal highness, would you rather go back out there?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - will you keep leaping out at me?
  ans:
  - i wanted to warn you.

- que:
  - why did you tell me?
  ans:
  - perhaps because you said i was beautiful.

- que:
  - you want to get us all slaughtered?
  ans:
  - yes, i warned him.

- que:
  - is that what you want?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you understand me?
  ans:
  - i am your humble servant, d'artagnan.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i even want to know your philosophical and political leanings.

- que:
  - is that why you wish to see me, to pass along advice?
  ans:
  - fires are erupting all over france.

- que:
  - and how did you deal with the ones who were not peasants?
  ans:
  - you confuse me.

- que:
  - do you know why france has come to this?
  ans:
  - the king, poor man, is weak.

- que:
  - how is it you have their trust?
  ans:
  - i helped them free revile.

- que:
  - and, of course, why give the musketeers a martyr?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - will it be soon?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - we escort the queen.

- que:
  - won't the king's guards escort her?
  ans:
  - no, the king does not know.

- que:
  - are you bragging?
  ans:
  - i will wait outside.

- que:
  - what do you call that card you are hiding in your sleeve?
  ans:
  - the ace of spades.

- que:
  - cannot go?
  ans:
  - there's something that i must do.

- que:
  - what is so important that you cannot help a musketeer?
  ans:
  - as you so frequently remind me, i'm not a musketeer.

- que:
  - i know you, don't i?
  ans:
  - i very much doubt it.

- que:
  - would you fight a man over nothing?
  ans:
  - enthusiastically.

- que:
  - you hear the most interesting things about yourself... when people think you're asleep, hmm?
  ans:
  - this is francesca bonacieux, an old friend.

- que:
  - perhaps a little to eat... and then on your way?
  ans:
  - i have no intention of leaving you.

- que:

  ans:
  - the lead horse lost a shoe.

  ans:

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - oh, how touching.

- que:
  - just one?
  ans:
  - i'm insulted.

- que:
  - for whom do you do this?
  ans:
  - for my own pleasure.

- que:
  - richelieu?
  ans:
  - no, he wouldn't go that far.

- que:
  - did you kill the spanish envoy?
  ans:
  - i would die before i help you.

- que:
  - why are you doing this?
  ans:
  - no, you said... that you liked children.

- que:

  ans:
  - milo.

- que:
  - the leviathan?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - that's a life preserver.

- que:
  - so you wear it and it preserves your life, like our crystals?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - oh, so it is a game?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - does that not make it hard for them to play the game?
  ans:
  - two weeks we crisscross the north sea and get nothing.

- que:
  - what if raising the crystal brought this leviathan to life?
  ans:
  - this could all be the fault of atlantis.

- que:

  ans:
  - that is not surprising.

- que:
  - then why is it still here?
  ans:
  - because it doesn't eat fish any more.

- que:
  - ew, what is that smell?
  ans:
  - it's like rotting fish.

- que:
  - why do you accuse such a thing?
  ans:

- que:
  - i'il distract him.
  ans:
  - where's audrey?

- que:
  - so if something stinks now, uh...
  ans:
  - are you crazy?

- que:
  - why you do this with your hand?
  ans:
  - it is the fish.

- que:
  - hey, where's kida?
  ans:
  - it's even more beautiful when the snow melts.

- que:
  - uh, not looking at the scenery, huh?
  ans:
  - maybe the crystal's too powerful.

- que:
  - what are the chances of another gas leak in a chinese laundry?
  ans:
  - so that's my last flower shop.

- que:
  - may i have your attention, please?
  ans:
  - hmm, that's better.

- que:

  ans:
  - mm, no, not exactly.

- que:
  - and this is unusual in your world?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:

- que:
  - now, uh, how about a sip of water?
  ans:
  - got a little sleepy in the foot.

- que:
  - and you say coyotes did this to you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - mr mckeane, what have we told you about the bacon grease?
  ans:
  - works better than any of your darn fool fix 'em ups.

- que:
  - is he going to be all right?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - so where did you find this?
  ans:
  - in a pot.

- que:
  - what pot?
  ans:
  - in the crate.

- que:
  - what crate?
  ans:
  - in my shack.

- que:
  - what shack?
  ans:
  - hmm.

- que:
  - you saw the man eat, right?
  ans:
  - lives like he eats... sloppy.

- que:
  - maid's day off, huh?
  ans:
  - quartz, uh, silicate, mixed with local clay.

- que:
  - from the sand?
  ans:
  - mckeane said they were sand coyotes.

- que:
  - oh, look, an antique.
  ans:
  - missin '?

- que:
  - how are people to use these things if they're locked behind glass?
  ans:
  - it's for protection.

- que:
  - but why is it in a glass case?
  ans:
  - no, the glass case is for protection.

- que:
  - wouldn't the spear be better protection than a glass case?
  ans:
  - yes...

- que:
  - why would someone want to steal a glass case?
  ans:
  - calcified limestone more than 25 million years old... from the cenozoic era.

- que:
  - how much is it?
  ans:
  - well, that's a museum class piece.

- que:
  - is this enough?
  ans:
  - kida, that that's a lot...

- que:
  - so, mr carnaby, where exactly do you get all of your artefacts?
  ans:
  - well, uh, here and there.

- que:
  - who are you people?
  ans:
  - we're associates of sam mckeane, and he's asked us to help locate the missing crate.

- que:
  - so you don't know anything about it?
  ans:
  - if mckeane lost a crate of pottery, that's not my problem.

- que:
  - what in the red rock river valley are you doin '?
  ans:
  - sampling the bowl.

- que:
  - would you like some?
  ans:
  - well, that could have gone better.

- que:
  - does it strike anybody as odd that carnaby knows the missing crate contains pottery?
  ans:
  - because i never mentioned what was in it.

- que:
  - perhaps they are brothers?
  ans:
  - twice is a coincidence.

- que:
  - but three times?
  ans:
  - i think someone's trying to tell us something.

- que:
  - can we offer you a ride?
  ans:
  - it's a long walk to anywhere.

- que:
  - you wouldn't happen to have a twin or two, would you?
  ans:
  - there are many noshoni men who walk alone in the desert.

- que:
  - where did that come from?
  ans:
  - every word.

- que:
  - how do you know that the missing crate contains pottery?
  ans:
  - uh, i don't.

- que:
  - and what do you know about an old man who calls himself chakashi?
  ans:
  - i know i got a shelf full of painted rocks of him inside.

- que:
  - we gave a ride to a spirit?
  ans:
  - you can't really believe in that superstition.

- que:
  - well, so what?
  ans:
  - mckeane found it in the desert... and then while he was in the hospital, i found it in his shack.

- que:
  - carnaby, that old pot can fit on any of those ledges.
  ans:
  - a hole?

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - naturally, i can't let you go free to tell the world about my discovery.
  ans:
  - that home made prairie grass mixture makes a good sleeping gas... wouldn't you agree?

- que:
  - nice nap?
  ans:
  - hope the rocks weren't too uncomfortable.

- que:
  - didn't i say so?
  ans:
  - i said,\\"i don't trust that carnaby.

- que:
  - uh, what is this?
  ans:
  - retribution.

- que:
  - what happened to carnaby?
  ans:
  - he is with us now.

- que:
  - what is this secret?
  ans:
  - prove to me that it is as great as what you see around you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - ah, we had break in last night.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm fine.

- que:
  - why would someone take an old spear... when there's so much other junk around?
  ans:
  - don't get me wrong.

- que:
  - do i own anything that's ordinary?
  ans:
  - regardless, i do have a good idea who took it.

- que:
  - what is ragnarok?
  ans:
  - doomsday in the old norse myths.

- que:
  - but why did mr hellstrom want the spear?
  ans:
  - seems to me i remember something about a spear in the shepherd's journal.

- que:
  - it it's iceland, you see?
  ans:
  - so if hellstrom is going to be stopped... it looks like you're going to iceland.

- que:
  - why can't ragnarok be in miami?
  ans:
  - you know, a nice, warm place.

- que:
  - kida?
  ans:
  - milo... my father knew the power of atlantis would be abused like this.

- que:
  - the old gods affecting the weather?
  ans:
  - well, there was that indian wind god, spirit, whatever, kraken.

- que:

  ans:
  - asgard.

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - you are a warrior born... my brunhilde, my daughter.

- que:
  - what have you done with my friends?
  ans:
  - i cast them out, brunhilde, into the abyss below.

  ans:
  - i heard shots.

- que:
  - what happened to alex?
  ans:
  - dan...

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - dan, if you think you have...... any obligation, you don't.

- que:

  ans:
  - now it's one against seven.

- que:
  - where are you?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - dan, where are you?
  ans:
  - alice.

- que:
  - did you hear that thunder?
  ans:
  - lf you're doing this for me...

- que:
  - for the money?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - for me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then why?
  ans:
  - i've got to, that's all.

- que:
  - you think i can do less?
  ans:
  - don't.

- que:
  - don't you think you'il make it?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - then why are you talking about a memory?
  ans:
  - i mean, the boys'il always remember...... i walked ben wade to the station.

- que:

  ans:
  - it worked real good.

- que:
  - why don't you wave to him?
  ans:
  - to do you a favour.

- que:
  - how do i know you'il jump?
  ans:
  - i don't like owing any favours.

- que:
  - we all start off in life with a dream, don't we?
  ans:
  - for a tennis player, it's being in the final of the grand slam... center court, a high lob, a smash.

- que:
  - you see that good looking fella?
  ans:
  - no, not the kid in white.

- que:
  - how long can peter colt keep playing this game?
  ans:
  - time to retire gracefully.

- que:
  - these young guys... where do they get the energy, the focus?
  ans:
  - no fear.

- que:
  - what happens then?
  ans:
  - i hope you don't mind, but i took the liberty of having it engraved.

- que:
  - is this the young man you were telling us about?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - won't we, ladies?
  ans:
  - oh, do shut up, sylvia.

- que:
  - what makes one tennis player different from another?
  ans:
  - it isn't a killer forehand or serve.

- que:
  - anybody home?
  ans:
  - hello, carl.

- que:
  - life still giving you trouble, is it?
  ans:
  - deep throat.\\"director's cut.

- que:
  - you all right, dad?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, yes.

- que:
  - you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet?
  ans:
  - cause, you know, i don't wanna miss your grand finale.

- que:
  - we're not invited?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what won't i like?
  ans:
  - hello, darling.

- que:
  - why is dad so upset?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - and do you know why?
  ans:
  - because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player.

- que:
  - losing?
  ans:
  - yeah, losing.

- que:
  - tickets?
  ans:
  - oh, god.

- que:
  - you really are a wanker, aren't you?
  ans:
  - harsh but fair.

- que:
  - dad, what are you doing up there?
  ans:
  - i should've moved up here years ago.

- que:
  - remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you need something?
  ans:
  - yeah, i...

- que:
  - what makes perfect sense?
  ans:
  - you see, i'd reserved a more modest room.

- que:
  - see now?
  ans:
  - that's much cozier.

- que:
  - i mean, i just want to focus on my game, you know?
  ans:
  - unfortunately...

- que:
  - gonna knock 'em dead this year, peter?
  ans:
  - that's the idea, danny.

- que:
  - gonna knock 'em dead this year, ivan?
  ans:
  - i'il do my best for you.

- que:
  - you wanna go for dinner?
  ans:
  - afraid not.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - intriguing irish girl.

- que:
  - she have a sister?
  ans:
  - only child.

- que:
  - forgotten me already?
  ans:
  - god, no.

- que:
  - and you're?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - lizzie, sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, just one more serve, daddy.

- que:
  - two seconds, okay?
  ans:
  - it's funny.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - 3:00.

- que:
  - you ever heard of him?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
  ans:
  - played him at bogota.

- que:
  - and you taught him that lesson in bogota?
  ans:
  - sadly, no.

- que:
  - isn't he playing your brother?
  ans:
  - you should be ashamed of yourself.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - not interested.

- que:
  - what wimbledon is this for you, peter?
  ans:
  - it's my 13th actually.

- que:
  - we can avoid all of this, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, you're probably right.

- que:
  - how's your injury?
  ans:
  - you have one new message.

- que:
  - uh, say, 7:00?
  ans:
  - room 1221.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - let me just...

- que:
  - are you hungry?
  ans:
  - um, not quite.

- que:
  - where do you come down on the whole\\"fooling around before a match\\"issue?
  ans:
  - well, that's a very intriguing question.

- que:
  - yes, it is, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it is... very sad.

- que:
  - are you?
  ans:
  - i'm interested.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i had been planning a brief press statement.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - absolutely fine with me.

- que:
  - peter?
  ans:
  - bugger.

- que:
  - last match of your career, and you got three games?
  ans:
  - time.

- que:
  - who would have thought, 40 minutes ago, that we'd be in a fifth set?
  ans:
  - 30 love.

- que:
  - peter, did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you've defeated in three years?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but who's really counting?
  ans:
  - what, uh...

- que:
  - what do you think of your next opponent?
  ans:
  - truthfully, in all the excitement, i haven't even checked to see who it is.

- que:
  - is your elbow playing up?
  ans:
  - well, if i admit to that, you may use it to your advantage.

- que:
  - dodgy shoulder maybe?
  ans:
  - the truth is, most everything aches.

- que:
  - mr. bradbury, hello.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - mr. bradbury?
  ans:
  - damn.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - come stai?
  ans:
  - you are the dragomir slayer.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - you look a million... lira.

- que:
  - do you know my partner, sophia?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for lizzie bradbury.

- que:
  - have you seen her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why do you think?
  ans:
  - oh, right.

- que:
  - looking for someone?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
  ans:
  - yes, it would.

- que:
  - it's colt, right?
  ans:
  - yes, but please call me peter.

- que:
  - do you see me as a distraction?
  ans:
  - that's exactly how i see you.

- que:
  - is that clear?
  ans:
  - i suppose, in a few thousand years, the english will evolve webbed feet.

- que:
  - oh, you know what?
  ans:
  - i think i'il...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - now that was quite funny.

- que:
  - i don't wanna win too easily, what with you and that, what is it, bad knee?
  ans:
  - i have a little confession to make.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - you were ahead, but then you totally fell apart, remember?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
  ans:
  - i couldn't get it out of my head.

- que:
  - like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - perhaps my first serve's getting a little mushy.

- que:
  - hardly anything, is it?
  ans:
  - barely moving.

- que:
  - did you wish on your next match?
  ans:
  - it wouldn't work if i told you.

- que:
  - who do you play?
  ans:
  - good friend of mine actually.

- que:
  - a friend?
  ans:
  - then you should know how to beat him.

- que:
  - what are his weaknesses?
  ans:
  - um, sausages, wagner, men in leather shorts.

- que:
  - now i have to kill him?
  ans:
  - without thinking twice.

- que:
  - why's that?
  ans:
  - you practice together, you travel together, you practically live together.

- que:
  - do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon?
  ans:
  - because that is killing him.

- que:
  - wh where the hell are the men's matches?
  ans:
  - man, roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets, mate.

- que:
  - didn't hear?
  ans:
  - you know, that bastard usually comes through for me.

- que:
  - are you, uh, peter colt's brother?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - well, aren't i popular?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - peter, remember me?
  ans:
  - it's your mother.

- que:
  - what did i always say about ya?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - so, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
  ans:
  - and cucumber.

- que:
  - what am i talking about?
  ans:
  - okay, well, i called you about a year ago, and i'm still waiting for you to return my call.

- que:
  - ron?
  ans:
  - that's a lie.

- que:
  - you want me to be completely honest with you?
  ans:
  - agents are not miracle workers.

- que:
  - you know what, ron?
  ans:
  - i genuinely despise you.

- que:
  - and you know what, peter?
  ans:
  - i really don't take it personally.

- que:
  - you got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - you'd have to cut your commission.

- que:
  - tea?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how they hangin '?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - and yours?
  ans:

  ans:
  - the one and only.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - nothing good, i hope.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - you look beautiful.

- que:
  - did i do that?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - lizzie, what's the deal?
  ans:
  - i've left you, like, half a dozen messages.

- que:
  - how about that?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - do you know peter colt?
  ans:
  - yeah, we did meet once.

- que:
  - did you hear?
  ans:
  - wait a second.

- que:
  - you are, aren't you?
  ans:
  - i don't believe this.

- que:
  - what are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
  ans:
  - i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...

- que:
  - are you all right, sir?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - yeah.
  ans:
  - lizzie?

- que:
  - but what about your dad?
  ans:
  - aw, let him find his own place.

- que:
  - what went wrong?
  ans:
  - she couldn't sing.

- que:
  - i mean, that's why we love the tour, isn't it?
  ans:
  - there's always another country, another airport.

- que:
  - you said\\"leslie.\\"who's leslie?
  ans:
  - as you can see, we've, uh, we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences.

- que:
  - piccy?
  ans:
  - just a bitty.

- que:
  - carl, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - uh, pete.

- que:
  - can i take a picture?
  ans:
  - no, you bloody can't.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - oh, i only got four pizzas.

- que:
  - everything all right?
  ans:
  - everything's great.

- que:
  - aren't we gonna have a workout?
  ans:
  - i thought we just had one.

- que:
  - now, are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - i usually do 10 miles.

- que:
  - why are you running behind me?
  ans:
  - there's something i haven't told you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - this is my last tournament, no matter what happens.

- que:
  - will he maintain his gentlemanly composure, or will he... dare i say... win the point?
  ans:
  - hold on.

- que:
  - what's happened to the ball?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - so, still bettin 'against your brother, are ya?
  ans:
  - it's tactical.

- que:
  - where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
  ans:
  - photojournalism.

- que:
  - where's my daughter?
  ans:
  - she...

- que:
  - are you bullshitting me?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - so, how was your trip down?
  ans:
  - the traffic can be murder getting out of london.

- que:
  - uh, wou would you like a cup of, uh, tea?
  ans:
  - maybe something stronger.

- que:
  - it's peter, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but you're not, are you?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, i was incredibly easy.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - she's hardly lost a set.

- que:
  - and what do you think that is?
  ans:
  - what we've been working towards all these years, what she's always wanted more than anything.

- que:
  - you're gonna go?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we can be together after the tournament.
  ans:
  - lizzie?

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - you can't just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, kid, but...

- que:
  - think you can go on?
  ans:
  - not so fast, chrissy.

- que:
  - the question is, will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish?
  ans:
  - he's never shown much of a killer instinct.

- que:
  - can we take another route?
  ans:
  - her match is at 3:00.

- que:
  - what's the score, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - it's match point.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship.

- que:
  - what do you think makes her so extraordinary?
  ans:
  - no embarrassment, no fear.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i hate making a decision.

- que:
  - where's the girl camped out, ron?
  ans:
  - 32 kensington place.

- que:
  - you want that on you conscience?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - lizzie?
  ans:
  - lizzie, it's me.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - that's an excellent question.

- que:
  - you have?
  ans:
  - but i need you to go.

- que:
  - is that what we're doing here?
  ans:
  - good thing you didn't get the wrong room.

- que:
  - mr. colt, are you okay?
  ans:
  - it's my back.

- que:
  - can you get up?
  ans:
  - i'm not entirely sure.

- que:
  - i'd love to see an english guy in the finals, but give me a break.
  ans:
  - how does he deal with it?

- que:
  - your shoulder was killing you, and what did you do then?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - can we just do a quickie?
  ans:

  ans:
  - it's just one of those days where i couldn't do anything wrong, and lizzie just couldn't do anything right.

- que:
  - it's not as if she can blame you, is it?
  ans:
  - i told you i needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days.

  ans:
  - it's not.

  - well, it's been quite a fortnight, hasn't it?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - who would have thought?
  ans:
  - i didn't think he was gonna do it.

- que:
  - ready, sir?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think i am.

- que:
  - what do you attribute this remarkable run to?
  ans:
  - you were supposed to make a very early exit.

- que:
  - love of the game?
  ans:
  - yeah, love of the game.

- que:
  - by the way, how's the weak back?
  ans:
  - it's fine.

- que:
  - how's the weak mind?
  ans:
  - gentlemen.

- que:
  - what are you doing, lad?
  ans:
  - get in here.

- que:
  - having a tough day?
  ans:
  - well, you know, disastrous.

- que:
  - why are you british apologizing all the time?
  ans:
  - don't apologize to me.

- que:
  - what'd you say?
  ans:
  - i said that the whole country has been waiting...

- que:
  - and who might that be?
  ans:
  - that might be a winner.

- que:
  - did he flee the building with the rain?
  ans:
  - i think he's in the lavatory.

- que:
  - is it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - his serve.

- que:
  - which one of my kids do i love more?

  ans:
  - that'il give an immediate adrenaline burst.

- que:
  - or is it the toss?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you see that?
  ans:
  - look at the chalk fly.

- que:
  - the question is, can he do it?
  ans:
  - after a call like that... a lot of players, including yours truly, would have a hard time getting back in the mind set.

- que:
  - that dream finally come true.
  ans:
  - what's wrong with you?

- que:
  - what else could ever come close?
  ans:
  - for a tennis player, it's being in the final of the grand slam... center court, a high lob, a smash.

- que:
  - you see that good looking fella?
  ans:
  - no, not the kid in white.

- que:
  - how long can peter colt keep playing this game?
  ans:
  - time to retire gracefully.

- que:
  - these young guys... where do they get the energy, the focus?
  ans:
  - no fear.

- que:
  - what happens then?
  ans:
  - i hope you don't mind, but i took the liberty of having it engraved.

- que:
  - is this the young man you were telling us about?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - won't we, ladies?
  ans:
  - oh, do shut up, sylvia.

- que:
  - what makes one tennis player different from another?
  ans:
  - it isn't a killer forehand or serve.

- que:
  - anybody home?
  ans:
  - deep throat.\\"director's cut.

- que:
  - you all right, dad?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, yes.

- que:
  - you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet?
  ans:
  - cause, you know, i don't wanna miss your grand finale.

- que:
  - we're not invited?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what won't i like?
  ans:
  - hello, darling.

- que:
  - why is dad so upset?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - and do you know why?
  ans:
  - because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player.

- que:
  - losing?
  ans:
  - yeah, losing.

- que:
  - tickets?
  ans:
  - oh, god.

- que:
  - you really are a wanker, aren't you?
  ans:
  - harsh but fair.

- que:
  - dad, what are you doing up there?
  ans:
  - i should've moved up here years ago.

- que:
  - remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you need something?
  ans:
  - yeah, i...

- que:
  - what makes perfect sense?
  ans:
  - you see, i'd reserved a more modest room.

- que:
  - see now?
  ans:
  - that's much cozier.

- que:
  - i mean, i just want to focus on my game, you know?
  ans:
  - unfortunately...

- que:
  - gonna knock 'em dead this year, peter?
  ans:
  - that's the idea, danny.

- que:
  - gonna knock 'em dead this year, ivan?
  ans:
  - i'il do my best for you.

- que:
  - you wanna go for dinner?
  ans:
  - afraid not.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - intriguing irish girl.

- que:
  - she have a sister?
  ans:
  - only child.

- que:
  - forgotten me already?
  ans:
  - god, no.

- que:
  - and you're?
  ans:
  - peter.

- que:
  - lizzie, sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, just one more serve, daddy.

- que:
  - two seconds, okay?
  ans:
  - it's funny.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - 3:00.

- que:
  - you ever heard of him?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
  ans:
  - played him at bogota.

- que:
  - and you taught him that lesson in bogota?
  ans:
  - sadly, no.

- que:
  - isn't he playing your brother?
  ans:
  - you should be ashamed of yourself.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - not interested.

- que:
  - what wimbledon is this for you, peter?
  ans:
  - it's my 13th actually.

- que:
  - we can avoid all of this, all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, you're probably right.

- que:
  - you still owe me fish and chips.
  ans:
  - how's your injury?

- que:
  - uh, say, 7:00?
  ans:
  - let me just...

- que:
  - are you hungry?
  ans:
  - um, not quite.

- que:
  - where do you come down on the whole\\"fooling around before a match\\"issue?
  ans:
  - well, that's a very intriguing question.

- que:
  - yes, it is, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it is... very sad.

- que:
  - are you?
  ans:
  - i'm interested.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i had been planning a brief press statement.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - absolutely fine with me.

- que:
  - peter?
  ans:
  - bugger.

- que:
  - last match of your career, and you got three games?
  ans:
  - time.

- que:
  - who would have thought, 40 minutes ago, that we'd be in a fifth set?
  ans:
  - 30 love.

- que:
  - peter, did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you've defeated in three years?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - but who's really counting?
  ans:
  - what, uh...

- que:
  - what do you think of your next opponent?
  ans:
  - truthfully, in all the excitement, i haven't even checked to see who it is.

- que:
  - is your elbow playing up?
  ans:
  - well, if i admit to that, you may use it to your advantage.

- que:
  - dodgy shoulder maybe?
  ans:
  - the truth is, most everything aches.

- que:
  - mr. bradbury, hello.
  ans:
  - hello?

- que:
  - mr. bradbury?
  ans:
  - damn.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - come stai?
  ans:
  - you are the dragomir slayer.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - you look a million... lira.

- que:
  - do you know my partner, sophia?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for lizzie bradbury.

- que:
  - have you seen her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why do you think?
  ans:
  - oh, right.

- que:
  - looking for someone?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
  ans:
  - yes, it would.

- que:
  - it's colt, right?
  ans:
  - yes, but please call me peter.

- que:
  - do you see me as a distraction?
  ans:
  - that's exactly how i see you.

- que:
  - is that clear?
  ans:
  - i suppose, in a few thousand years, the english will evolve webbed feet.

- que:
  - oh, you know what?
  ans:
  - i think i'il...

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - now that was quite funny.

- que:
  - i don't wanna win too easily, what with you and that, what is it, bad knee?
  ans:
  - i have a little confession to make.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - you were ahead, but then you totally fell apart, remember?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
  ans:
  - i couldn't get it out of my head.

- que:
  - like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - perhaps my first serve's getting a little mushy.

- que:
  - hardly anything, is it?
  ans:
  - barely moving.

- que:
  - did you wish on your next match?
  ans:
  - it wouldn't work if i told you.

- que:
  - who do you play?
  ans:
  - good friend of mine actually.

- que:
  - a friend?
  ans:
  - then you should know how to beat him.

- que:
  - what are his weaknesses?
  ans:
  - um, sausages, wagner, men in leather shorts.

- que:
  - now i have to kill him?
  ans:
  - without thinking twice.

- que:
  - why's that?
  ans:
  - you practice together, you travel together, you practically live together.

- que:
  - do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon?
  ans:
  - because that is killing him.

- que:
  - wh where the hell are the men's matches?
  ans:
  - man, roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets, mate.

- que:
  - didn't hear?
  ans:
  - you know, that bastard usually comes through for me.

- que:
  - are you, uh, peter colt's brother?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - well, aren't i popular?
  ans:
  - peter. lan frazier from the club.

- que:
  - peter, remember me?
  ans:
  - it's your mother.

- que:
  - what did i always say about ya?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - so, uh, cucumber and cucumber?
  ans:
  - and cucumber.

- que:
  - what am i talking about?
  ans:
  - okay, well, i called you about a year ago, and i'm still waiting for you to return my call.

- que:
  - ron?
  ans:
  - that's a lie.

- que:
  - you want me to be completely honest with you?
  ans:
  - agents are not miracle workers.

- que:
  - you know what, ron?
  ans:
  - i genuinely despise you.

- que:
  - and you know what, peter?
  ans:
  - i really don't take it personally.

- que:
  - you got a problem with that?
  ans:
  - you'd have to cut your commission.

- que:
  - tea?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how they hangin '?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - and yours?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:

  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - the\\"peter peter colt?
  ans:
  - the one and only.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - you look beautiful.

- que:
  - did i do that?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - lizzie, what's the deal?
  ans:
  - i've left you, like, half a dozen messages.

- que:
  - how about that?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - do you know peter colt?
  ans:
  - yeah, we did meet once.

- que:
  - did you hear?
  ans:
  - wait a second.

- que:
  - you are, aren't you?
  ans:
  - i don't believe this.

- que:
  - what are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?
  ans:
  - i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...

- que:
  - are you all right, sir?
  ans:
  - i'm fine.

- que:
  - yeah.
  ans:
  - lizzie?

- que:
  - but what about your dad?
  ans:
  - aw, let him find his own place.

- que:
  - what went wrong?
  ans:
  - she couldn't sing.

- que:
  - i mean, that's why we love the tour, isn't it?
  ans:
  - there's always another country, another airport.

- que:
  - who's leslie?
  ans:
  - as you can see, we've, uh, we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences.

- que:
  - piccy?
  ans:
  - just a bitty.

- que:
  - carl, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - uh, pete.

- que:
  - can i take a picture?
  ans:
  - no, you bloody can't.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - oh, i only got four pizzas.

- que:
  - everything all right?
  ans:
  - everything's great.

- que:
  - aren't we gonna have a workout?
  ans:
  - i thought we just had one.

- que:
  - now, are you sure about this?
  ans:
  - i usually do 10 miles.

- que:
  - why are you running behind me?
  ans:
  - there's something i haven't told you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - this is my last tournament, no matter what happens.

- que:
  - will he maintain his gentlemanly composure, or will he... dare i say... win the point?
  ans:
  - hold on.

- que:
  - what's happened to the ball?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - so, still bettin 'against your brother, are ya?
  ans:
  - it's tactical.

- que:
  - where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
  ans:
  - photojournalism.

- que:
  - where's my daughter?
  ans:
  - she...

- que:
  - are you bullshitting me?
  ans:
  - absolutely not.

- que:
  - so, how was your trip down?
  ans:
  - the traffic can be murder getting out of london.

- que:
  - uh, wou would you like a cup of, uh, tea?
  ans:
  - maybe something stronger.

- que:
  - it's peter, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - but you're not, are you?
  ans:
  - as a matter of fact, i was incredibly easy.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - she's hardly lost a set.

- que:
  - and what do you think that is?
  ans:
  - what we've been working towards all these years, what she's always wanted more than anything.

- que:
  - you're gonna go?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we can be together after the tournament.
  ans:
  - lizzie?

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - you can't just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, kid, but...

- que:
  - think you can go on?
  ans:
  - not so fast, chrissy.

- que:
  - the question is, will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish?
  ans:
  - he's never shown much of a killer instinct.

- que:
  - can we take another route?
  ans:
  - her match is at 3:00.

- que:
  - what's the score, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - it's match point.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship.

- que:
  - what do you think makes her so extraordinary?
  ans:
  - no embarrassment, no fear.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i hate making a decision.

- que:
  - where's the girl camped out, ron?
  ans:
  - 32 kensington place.

- que:
  - you want that on you conscience?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - lizzie?
  ans:
  - lizzie, it's me.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - that's an excellent question.

- que:
  - you have?
  ans:
  - but i need you to go.

- que:
  - is that what we're doing here?
  ans:
  - good thing you didn't get the wrong room.

- que:
  - mr. colt, are you okay?
  ans:
  - it's my back.

- que:
  - can you get up?
  ans:
  - i'm not entirely sure.

- que:
  - i'd love to see an english guy in the finals, but give me a break.
  ans:
  - how does he deal with it?

- que:
  - your shoulder was killing you, and what did you do then?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - can we just do a quickie?
  ans:
  - no, not right now.

- que:
  - how'd she do?
  ans:
  - it's just one of those days where i couldn't do anything wrong, and lizzie just couldn't do anything right.

- que:
  - it's not as if she can blame you, is it?
  ans:
  - i told you i needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days.

- que:
  - that's why you think i'm here?
  ans:
  - it's not.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - i know you want me to think... that we're falling in love or some bullshit, but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning.

- que:
  - and you know what?
  ans:

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip.

- que:
  - i would kill for another dozen of those... what do you call the... those little cucumber sandwiches?
  ans:
  - cucumber sandwiches.

- que:
  - for god's sake, what...
  ans:
  - you brits got a name for everything, huh?

  ans:
  - that's weird.

- que:
  - mrs. paley, are you sure you didn't leave the dog at home?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - mrs. paley, what do you do for living?
  ans:
  - oh, nothing.

  ans:
  - nothing very exciting.

- que:
  - where did you work?

- que:
  - what just happened?
  ans:
  - it took my head, man.

- que:
  - i read it in rosenzweig book, it was a big part of this theory.
  ans:
  - how do you know that, jerry?

- que:
  - when you found the watch, yeah.
  ans:
  - what if whoever designed this stinking thing somehow managed to create a place where parallel realities can crossover like that?

- que:
  - and we realized that somebody else had been marking numbers in the rooms, right?
  ans:
  - that's when i thought maybe we should leave markers behind, in case we doubled back and got side tracked.

- que:
  - there's got to be a logical explanation.
  ans:
  - yes!

- que:
  - this is just an optical illusion or something?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - finally, yeah.

- que:
  - if max is right, why don't you go and open that door?
  ans:
  - oh, come on.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - i think jerry's either full of shit or part of this experiment.

- que:
  - hey, man, what are you doing?
  ans:
  - just don't fucking open the door.

- que:
  - what are you so scared of anyway?
  ans:
  - i just saw my fucking head taken off by something or other.

- que:
  - where did you get that knife?
  ans:
  - you're funny, mrs. paley.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon?
  ans:
  - maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

- que:
  - i think we should keep moving, huh?
  ans:
  - after you.

- que:
  - are we there yet?
  ans:
  - come on, mrs. paley.

- que:
  - are you kidding?
  ans:

- que:
  - can i switch off the tv?

  ans:
  - boring, rather.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - is that why you're in a bad mood?
  ans:
  - my piano teacher.

- que:
  - and even if it were true, would it be such a shameful motive?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what have you brought?
  ans:
  - you should forget schubert.

- que:
  - is this your last lesson?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - if you won't be quiet, you'il end up all alone here.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - you said we.

- que:
  - who would do such a thing?
  ans:
  - the police say it must have been another student acting out of jealousy.

- que:
  - being so evil?
  ans:
  - she's always been a loner.

- que:
  - who will replace anna for the concert?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - forte piano.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - pianissimo.

- que:
  - why not stick to clementi?
  ans:
  - schubert was quite ugly.

- que:
  - did you know?
  ans:
  - with your looks, nothing can ever hurt you.

- que:
  - why destroy what could bring us together?
  ans:
  - mannerism is no...

- que:
  - why can't i look at you?
  ans:
  - because if i do, i won't resist the temptation to kiss you on the neck.

- que:
  - can i get you a glass of water?
  ans:
  - thanks.

- que:
  - when can i see you?
  ans:

  - you've still got it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you want to finish me off?
  ans:
  - i said i don't want to read any letters.

- que:
  - is that why we barricaded the door?
  ans:
  - perhaps.

- que:
  - you want a slap?
  ans:
  - for that is my dearest wish.

- que:
  - what will all this open up for me?
  ans:
  - maybe you'd open your cultured mouth and comment on this shit.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - if you catch me disobeying any of your orders, hit me, please, even with the back of your hand on my face.

- que:
  - move that chest.
  ans:
  - what's going on in there?

- que:
  - do you have no sense of decency?
  ans:
  - i hope you're not.

- que:

  ans:
  - that piece is missing.

- que:
  - what you wanted to hear?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and what were their stories?
  ans:
  - it helps us to understand where we came from, or where we're going.

  - yeah, all the time.

- que:
  - how long has it been open?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we're good.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - all right?\"\\"all right\\"is not the word.

- que:
  - what have you got?
  ans:
  - come here.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - oh, my god.

- que:
  - it's amazing.... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
  ans:
  - hold this.

- que:
  - what are you doing, marek?
  ans:
  - it's ok.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - it's definitely a modern day bifocal lens.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - one of the documents you found.

- que:
  - \\"4/ 2/ 1357\"?
  ans:
  - 1357.

- que:
  - what is going on?
  ans:
  - i cross matched the signatures.

- que:
  - what's going on here?
  ans:
  - francois is looking for his spare pair.

- que:
  - what have you been smoking?
  ans:
  - maybe you can explain.

- que:
  - did you carbon date the ink?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - have i made myself clear?
  ans:
  - just tell us when and where.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - doniger's sending a plane for us.

- que:
  - we're going to new mexico?
  ans:
  - let's pack up, guys.

- que:
  - where's my dad?
  ans:
  - you'il see your dad shortly.

- que:
  - where's doniger at?
  ans:
  - pleading for help.

- que:
  - like a fax or something?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - he's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
  ans:
  - follow me.

- que:
  - you actually made it work?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the prototype?
  ans:
  - so that thing that we just passed...

- que:
  - exactly.... is the real thing?
  ans:
  - we asked the same question.

- que:
  - so, what does that mean?
  ans:
  - the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard, france in the year 1 357.

- que:
  - so you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
  ans:
  - no, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.

- que:
  - so you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
  ans:
  - no, chris.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we need you to help get him back.

- que:
  - did he know about all this?
  ans:
  - i thought we could help each other.

- que:
  - how could you send him there?
  ans:
  - god knows where he is...

- que:
  - you sent the professor to the hundred years 'war?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
  ans:
  - once he's broken us into a stream of electrons.

- que:
  - why should we do what you ask us?
  ans:
  - i think we need to know more...

- que:
  - bob?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - you don't think they deserve to know that?
  ans:
  - i've told them enough.

- que:
  - how did my father get stuck back there?
  ans:
  - doniger gave him an hour.

- que:
  - i guess it's better him than you, right?
  ans:
  - listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we leave.

- que:
  - why do we need marines?
  ans:
  - just in case something goes wrong.

- que:
  - do you understand what it does?
  ans:
  - it strips you down to a molecular level, which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.

- que:
  - why do we need him?
  ans:
  - because he speaks french fluently.

- que:
  - keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
  ans:
  - mr. stern.

- que:
  - watch our backs, ok?
  ans:
  - it will be all right.

- que:
  - you know the 50 bucks i owe you?
  ans:
  - all right, let's move it.

- que:
  - what about weapons?
  ans:
  - nothing modern goes back.

- que:
  - countdown?
  ans:
  - they burn out after six hours.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - i'il get you back before you know it.

- que:
  - are we set?
  ans:
  - all systems check.

- que:
  - mr. marek?
  ans:
  - mr. marek, i need you to take your position.

- que:
  - what the hell are we doing?
  ans:
  - getting the chance of a lifetime.

- que:
  - how long does it take?
  ans:
  - a couple of seconds.

- que:
  - here, take my hand.
  ans:
  - where is he?

- que:
  - everybody all right?
  ans:
  - that was a close one.

- que:
  - gordon, is this it?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - are we in 1357 france?
  ans:
  - this could be oregon.

- que:
  - but don't.
  ans:
  - gordon, where are we?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - we haven't found his dad yet.

- que:
  - where's marek?
  ans:
  - the guys came after baretto.

- que:
  - where's gomez?
  ans:
  - i didn't see him.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, shit.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm getting us out of here.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i was trying to tell you.

- que:
  - what about gomez?
  ans:
  - we can't do anything about him now.

- que:
  - give me your gloves.
  ans:
  - what happened to the rest of them?

- que:
  - well, did anyone try to come back with him?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i know as much as you, ok?
  ans:
  - hang on.

- que:
  - what if they're trying to come back now?
  ans:
  - it's not gonna happen...

- que:
  - where is everyone going?
  ans:
  - hold on a second.

- que:
  - what day is this?
  ans:
  - marek...

- que:
  - the day la roque falls?
  ans:
  - wait, wait.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you son of a bitch.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - you brought us back on the day the french attack.

- que:
  - how long will this take?
  ans:
  - five hours and 27 minutes.

- que:
  - how do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
  ans:
  - because that's all the time we have.

- que:
  - once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
  ans:
  - the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.

- que:
  - is that what you're saying?
  ans:
  - they could be.

- que:
  - what if my dad's in there?
  ans:
  - yeah, you're right.

- que:
  - how are we gonna get in?
  ans:
  - guys, soldiers coming.

- que:
  - come on, my friend.
  ans:
  - why aren't you packing up?

- que:
  - who are they?
  ans:
  - we captured them in the village.

- que:
  - who speaks for you?
  ans:
  - i do, my lord.

- que:
  - you've come to kill us all in our beds?
  ans:
  - first the old man and now this group.

- que:
  - why do the scottish find this village so pleasing?
  ans:
  - it must be your lord's kind manners.

- que:
  - edward de johnness?
  ans:
  - he claims he's a magister.

- que:
  - do you know of him?
  ans:
  - he's our master, sir.

- que:
  - all is well with him?
  ans:
  - he said he was alone.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - yes, you.

  - the spaniards, am i at war with them?
  ans:

  - no?
  ans:

  - how did you survive that?
  ans:
  - i promised oliver a new weapon.

- que:
  - what kind of weapon?
  ans:
  - a liquid fire so intense that even water couldn't harm it.

- que:
  - professor, i'm sorry, have you considered what you may have done?
  ans:
  - you've given the english a serious advantage in this battle.

- que:
  - remember that field where the peasant huts were?
  ans:
  - that's the closest place with enough room to use the marker.

- que:
  - how do we get there?
  ans:
  - we have to do it fast.

- que:
  - may i ask why you're trespassing on my land?
  ans:
  - come, come.

- que:
  - what are you doing, marek?
  ans:
  - it's ok.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - it's definitely a modern day bifocal lens.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - one of the documents you found.

- que:
  - \\"4/ 2/ 1357\"?
  ans:
  - 1357.

- que:
  - what is going on?
  ans:
  - i cross matched the signatures.

- que:
  - what's going on here?
  ans:
  - franois is looking for his spare pair.

- que:
  - what have you been smoking?
  ans:
  - maybe you can explain.

- que:
  - did you carbon date the ink?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - have i made myself clear?
  ans:
  - just tell us when and where.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:

  - you'il see your dad shortly.

- que:
  - where's doniger at?
  ans:
  - pleading for help.

- que:
  - like a fax or something?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - he's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
  ans:
  - follow me.

- que:
  - you actually made it work?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the prototype?
  ans:
  - so that thing that we just passed...

- que:
  - exactly.... is the real thing?
  ans:
  - we asked the same question.

- que:
  - so, what does that mean?
  ans:
  - the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard, france in the year 1357.

- que:
  - so you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
  ans:
  - no, we accidentally discovered a wormhole.

- que:
  - so you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
  ans:
  - no, chris.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we need you to help get him back.

- que:
  - did he know about all this?
  ans:
  - i thought we could help each other.

- que:
  - how could you send him there?
  ans:
  - god knows where he is...

- que:
  - you sent the professor to the hundred years 'war?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
  ans:
  - once he's broken us into a stream of electrons.

- que:
  - why should we do what you ask us?
  ans:
  - i think we need to know more...

- que:
  - bob?
  ans:
  - excuse me, i need to get them changed if they're going to go.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - you don't think they deserve to know that?
  ans:
  - i've told them enough.

- que:
  - how did my father get stuck back there?
  ans:
  - doniger gave him an hour.

- que:
  - i guess it's better him than you, right?
  ans:
  - listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we leave.

- que:
  - why do we need marines?
  ans:
  - just in case something goes wrong.

- que:
  - do you understand what it does?
  ans:
  - it strips you down to a molecular level. which means, for a moment, you cease to exist.

- que:
  - why do we need him?
  ans:
  - because he speaks french fluently.

- que:
  - keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right?
  ans:
  - mr. stern.

- que:
  - watch our backs, ok?
  ans:
  - it will be all right.

- que:
  - you know the 50 bucks i owe you?
  ans:
  - all right, let's move it.

- que:
  - what about weapons?
  ans:
  - nothing modern goes back.

- que:
  - countdown?
  ans:
  - they burn out after six hours.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - i'il get you back before you know it.

- que:
  - are we set?
  ans:
  - all systems check.

- que:
  - mr. marek?
  ans:
  - mr. marek.

- que:
  - what the hell are we doing?
  ans:
  - getting the chance of a lifetime.

- que:
  - how long does it take?
  ans:
  - a couple of seconds.

- que:
  - here, take my hand.
  ans:
  - where is he?

- que:
  - everybody all right?
  ans:
  - that was a close one.

- que:
  - gordon, is this it?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - are we in 1357 france?
  ans:
  - this could be oregon.

- que:
  - but don't.
  ans:
  - gordon, where are we?

- que:

  ans:
  - we haven't found his dad yet.

- que:
  - where's marek?
  ans:
  - the guys came after baretto.

- que:
  - where's gomez?
  ans:
  - i didn't see him.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - oh, shit, i can't find his marker.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm getting us out of here.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i was trying to tell you.

- que:
  - what about gomez?
  ans:
  - we can't do anything about him now.

- que:
  - give me your gloves.
  ans:
  - what happened to the rest of them?

- que:
  - well, did anyone try to come back with him?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i know as much as you, ok?
  ans:
  - hang on.

- que:
  - what if they're trying to come back now?
  ans:
  - it's not gonna happen...

- que:
  - where is everyone going?
  ans:
  - hold on a second.

- que:
  - what day is this?
  ans:
  - marek...

- que:
  - the day la roque falls?
  ans:
  - wait, wait.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - you brought us back on the day the french attack.

- que:
  - how long will this take?
  ans:
  - five hours and 27 minutes.

- que:
  - how do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
  ans:
  - because that's all the time we have.

- que:
  - once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them?
  ans:
  - the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers.

- que:
  - is that what you're saying?
  ans:
  - they could be.

- que:
  - what if my dad's in there?
  ans:
  - yeah, you're right.

- que:
  - how are we gonna get in?
  ans:
  - guys, soldiers coming.

- que:
  - why do the scottish find this village so pleasing?
  ans:
  - it must be your lord's kind manners.

- que:

  ans:
  - and so the baudelaire children went to peru and together had wonderful adventures with their loving and wonderful new guardian.

- que:
  - now, go on.
  ans:
  - now, why would you say something like that?

- que:
  - what's he up to?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you have experience with children?
  ans:
  - children are strange and foreign to me.

  ans:
  - such a pretty girl.

- que:
  - uncle monty?
  ans:
  - it's like walking up the stairs to your bedroom in the dark and thinking that there's one more stair than there is.

  ans:
  - the children's grief was not only for their uncle but for that tender hope that they may have found home again.

- que:
  - detective?
  ans:
  - little girl, the big cage door is open, no snake.

- que:
  - i'm thinking,\\"who woke me up at 9 in the morning for this?
  ans:
  - it's definitely a snake bite.

- que:
  - you mind if i skip the paperwork on this?
  ans:
  - i think that'd be best.

- que:
  - doc, what do you think?
  ans:
  - could be the only chance for them to get closure.

- que:
  - where am i gonna get a train?
  ans:
  - children, that's enough of this foolishness.

  ans:
  - oh, no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - well, i'm always afraid that the doorknobs will shatter into a million tiny pieces, and one of them will hit my eye.

- que:

- que:
  - you wanna play me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - you know i do.

- que:
  - hey, deb, can you take a photo of me on the horse real quick?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - what is so important that you interrupt us?
  ans:
  - prince frederick of saxony.

- que:
  - you mean you've traveled all the way from rome just in order to advise us about this small matter?
  ans:
  - heresy is never a small matter, my lord.

- que:
  - how would people fare left to themselves, helpless and frightened?
  ans:
  - all my life, i have seen a world that hates evil more than it loves good.

- que:
  - did you really think there wouldn't be a cost?
  ans:
  - it is simply a matter of individual conscience.

- que:
  - do you, martin luther, recognize these books?
  ans:
  - tle 95 tleses.

- que:

  ans:
  - all are mine.

  - do you recant what you've written?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - may i have time to consider?
  ans:
  - you have had the time, and you should have been prepared to answer.

- que:
  - where's his boasting...?
  ans:
  - i am yours.

- que:
  - martin luther, are you the author of these writings?
  ans:
  - i am.

- que:
  - do you recant what you have written here?
  ans:
  - i cannot renounce all of my works because they are not all the same.

- que:
  - will you recant or will you not?
  ans:
  - since your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply...

- que:
  - what do you say?
  ans:
  - he is too daring for me, my lord.

- que:
  - why are they leaving us?
  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - why are you babbling in riddles?
  ans:
  - beware, or you too shall be cut down.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i asked for a greek new testament.

- que:
  - to have a new testament in german, in words ordinary people can understand?
  ans:
  - it's the thing rome fears most.

- que:
  - how do you expect to do this?
  ans:
  - we must send in soldiers.

- que:
  - and cause more bloodshed?
  ans:
  - if wittenberg cannot settle its religious problems without that, then the rest of the world will not be impressed.

- que:
  - how's the work?
  ans:
  - tricky.

- que:
  - how can i write for our people when i don't live among them?
  ans:
  - the language of the bible should be like a mother talking to her children.

- que:
  - why were they killed?
  ans:
  - no reason.

- que:
  - you, why are you standing there?
  ans:
  - when a limb is rotten, you must cut it off.

- que:
  - beat me out?
  ans:
  - i defended you.

- que:
  - you think this is my work?
  ans:
  - it's the people's work.

- que:
  - now, how is he?
  ans:
  - luther's depressed, my lord.

- que:
  - but he will join them?
  ans:
  - luther abhors violence.

- que:
  - but he's in sympathy with their grievances?
  ans:
  - it's hard to argue against freeing people from crippling taxes or the purgatory of being born slaves all their lives.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - no one knows yet.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - some say 50, 000.

- que:
  - and... you still came here?
  ans:
  - because this is where dr. luther lives.

- que:
  - who's there?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - martin luther?
  ans:
  - my lord.

- que:
  - into german?
  ans:
  - but this will separate us from rome... forever.

- que:
  - with no compromises?
  ans:
  - none.

- que:
  - do you think i could have my present now?
  ans:
  - send it back.

- que:
  - what has happened?
  ans:
  - the emperor summons our princes to augsburg.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - to finish what he began at worms.

- que:
  - how will you make them change their minds?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - if we challenge charles, will there be war... the awful shedding of yet more blood?
  ans:
  - i honestly don't know.

- que:
  - or our greatest opportunity so far?
  ans:
  - and remember, since i may not come with you to augsburg, you'il face charles 'rough alone.

- que:
  - and why does the father run to meet his prodigal son?
  ans:
  - landowners don't run.

- que:
  - so why does this rich, landowning father run?
  ans:
  - because he's afraid.

- que:
  - and you know what this word means?
  ans:
  - god brought me here.

- que:
  - i live in terror of judgment.
  ans:
  - god?

- que:
  - i wish there were no god.
  ans:
  - and you think self hatred will save you?

- que:
  - name of the deceased and relation?
  ans:
  - hendrick luther.

- que:
  - name of the deceased and relation?
  ans:
  - wolfram eschen, uncle.

- que:
  - let's go outside.
  ans:

- que:
  - what's wrong with here?
  ans:
  - well, this floor... the color.

- que:
  - have you ever read the new testament, martin?
  ans:
  - no, father.

- que:
  - wittenberg?
  ans:
  - a doctorate in theology.

- que:
  - you're sending me away to study?
  ans:
  - i'm sending you to the source... the scriptures.

- que:
  - here i'm losing my faith, feeling like a fool even to pray, and you're sending me away?
  ans:
  - you'il preach.

- que:
  - to change things?
  ans:
  - welcome to wittenberg, father martin.

- que:
  - a child living in the forest?
  ans:
  - a crippled child.

- que:
  - half or full bundle?
  ans:
  - as much as this will buy.

- que:
  - they thought i wanted their money?
  ans:
  - no, they thought the pope wanted their money.

- que:
  - the greek christians?
  ans:
  - well, an early church document clearly states that a roman bishop, not a greek, was saint peter's successor.

- que:
  - so we must consider the saints of the greek church to be damned?
  ans:
  - you miss the point.

- que:
  - you question the authority of the church council, sir?
  ans:
  - if only we knew what was in his head.

- que:
  - what does god say, father, for suicide?
  ans:
  - i never, never said i had the answers.

- que:
  - is this child any more to blame for the despair that overtook him than an innocent man who is murdered by a robber in the woods?
  ans:
  - god must be mercy.

- que:
  - what of it?
  ans:
  - for i know one who suffered and made satisfaction in my behalf.

- que:
  - to teach theology?
  ans:
  - he undermines the prince.

- que:
  - was i an arrogant fool?
  ans:
  - now they have made me a doctor of divinity, and i'm tempted to believe that this scholar's robe will make me wise.

- que:
  - did you buy an indulgence?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - master kranauer, is luther open to persuasion?
  ans:
  - not likely, my prince.

- que:
  - as a donkey, you were going to say?
  ans:
  - indeed, indeed.

- que:
  - quite dignified looking, isn't he?
  ans:
  - but it's not what julius wanted.

- que:
  - what is it you seek, aleander?
  ans:
  - to serve god.

- que:
  - moreover, wasn't he underage when granted his first post?
  ans:
  - just so.

- que:
  - the imperial bankers?
  ans:
  - an eight year loan.

- que:
  - and how would he repay them?
  ans:
  - even one finger made raw by the flame will torment you throughout the night.

- que:
  - are we to be spared the fires of damnation on the judgment day?
  ans:
  - take heed the words of your holy father who says,

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - with this indulgence.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - tonight, and only tonight.

- que:
  - do you not hear their voices, the screaming voices?
  ans:
  - your deceased parents.

- que:
  - god fearing man, do you have a coin for christ?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - name?
  ans:
  - we can preach until we're hoarse, but if we cannot bring the christ of the gospels to our people...

- que:
  - issued by the archbishop of mainz.
  ans:
  - ... what do we offer them?

- que:
  - where did you get this?
  ans:
  - juterbog.

- que:
  - it's no good?
  ans:
  - you must put your trust in god's love.

- que:
  - german money for the german church.
  ans:
  - if the pope can empty purgatory, why would he not do so out of love rather than for money?

- que:
  - or saint paul?
  ans:
  - we don't need your saints.

- que:
  - or any of the holy apostles?
  ans:
  - with this indulgence, i can absolve any sin.

- que:
  - sober him.
  ans:
  - how will you explain this to rome?

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i did not want him compromised.

- que:
  - do you have any idea how embarrassing this is to prince frederick, his prize professor of theology drawing condemnation from the pope?
  ans:
  - my criticism was not of the holy father himself, but of those rogues who claim to represent him.

- que:
  - what happens now?
  ans:
  - i honestly don't know.

- que:
  - have i caused you trouble too?
  ans:
  - i'm here to get you through this.

- que:
  - that's a good sign, isn't it?
  ans:
  - that means that rome must understand.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have i erred?
  ans:
  - yes, you have erred.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - that i may avoid such error again.

- que:
  - which of my teachings is offensive to rome?
  ans:
  - for one, indulgences.

- que:
  - comfort?
  ans:
  - the turks are building armies on our eastern borders.

- que:
  - or shall we call it extravagante like the rest of the world?
  ans:
  - he's a heretic.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - then there is only one way to save your life.

- que:
  - my prince. how shall i answer?
  ans:
  - the cardinal demands that luther be delivered to rome or banished from saxony.

- que:
  - have you read luther's work?
  ans:
  - yes, all of it.

- que:
  - did he show any inclination then of surrender to influence?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so what shall we say to the cardinal?
  ans:

  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - just friends?
  ans:
  - just friends.

- que:
  - don't you get it?
  ans:
  - this was bad.

- que:

  ans:
  - they're downstairs.

- que:

- que:
  - are you gonna tell him?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - well, you're not gonna... are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had?
  ans:
  - dre... what just happened was the most... amazing... most fulfilling... most exhilarating... 5 minutes i've ever had in my life.

- que:
  - 9?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - the point is, what do we do now?
  ans:
  - we can't just go back to the way things were.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - i need space.

- que:
  - why does it have to be all or nothing?
  ans:
  - because we both know it's the right thing to do.

- que:
  - but, you know, when you go in there, just, you know, be firm with them, you know what i'm sayin '?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you were feeling her, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - she wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude, but you let it ride, you know?
  ans:
  - same thing bogey did, man.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - cause he's humphrey bogart.

- que:
  - you know what he needed to do back then?
  ans:
  - he needed to stop fine ass ingrid bergman from gettin 'on the plane with the corny dude.

- que:
  - with another dude, in the fog?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - 2 grown men walk off in a fog, you don't know where they goin '?
  ans:
  - think about it, man.

- que:
  - can you leave me a couple more of those?
  ans:
  - and thanks for coming by.

- que:
  - i said to give me space and then you pull this stuff?
  ans:
  - what...

- que:
  - what are you talkin 'about?
  ans:
  - guess what demo i heard for our unsigned underground review today.

- que:
  - are you serious?
  ans:
  - dre, don't act like you didn't plan this.

- que:
  - why would i need to plan?
  ans:
  - i could have just given it to you at any time.

- que:
  - why'd you give it to gabe?
  ans:
  - i gave you money to help start the label.

- que:
  - doesn't the conflict of interest seem obvious?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - well, what did gabe say?
  ans:
  - it wasn't a bad review.

- que:
  - what's wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip hop in the first place?
  ans:
  - cause it's about forward movement.

- que:
  - and that's why we need to look back, ok?
  ans:
  - cause if we look back, it will make us see things...

- que:
  - are we... are we still talking about hip hop?
  ans:
  - that's all we've ever talked about.

- que:
  - sid?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - can i get you something, sir?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you couldn't afford it then, remember?
  ans:
  - i had to keep playing if i was gonna get your number.

- que:
  - so we could have a drink, laugh on our good times, and, uh, act like none of this ever happened?
  ans:
  - yes and no.

- que:
  - are you serious?
  ans:
  - dre, let me finish.

- que:
  - another round?
  ans:
  - damn.

- que:
  - what am i talking about?
  ans:

  - didn't i already see you?
  ans:

  - sid... when did you fall in love... with hip hop?
  ans:
  - talk to him.

- que:
  - uh, why'd it take you so long to say that?
  ans:
  - cause i was scared.

- que:
  - down here?
  ans:
  - a big day for brown sugar records.

- que:
  - you wanna go out with me?
  ans:
  - they've shut down the main reactor.

- que:
  - where have you been?
  ans:
  - they're heading in this direction.

- que:
  - wait a minute.
  ans:
  - what are we going to do?

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - the death star plans are not in the main computer.

- que:
  - what have you done with those plans?
  ans:
  - we intercepted no transmissions.

- que:
  - if this is a consular ship... were is the ambassador?
  ans:
  - commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the ambassador.

  ans:
  - secret mission?

- que:
  - are you sure this things safe?
  ans:
  - lord vader, i should have known.

- que:
  - how did i get into this mess?
  ans:
  - i really don't know how.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - well, i'm not going that way.

- que:
  - what makes you think there are settlements over there?
  ans:
  - don't get technical with me.

- que:
  - he tricked me into going this way, but he'il do no better.
  ans:
  - what mission?

- que:
  - we're doomed.
  ans:
  - wait, what's that?

- que:
  - will this never end?
  ans:
  - luke, tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce.

- que:
  - do you speak bocce?
  ans:
  - of course i can, sir.

- que:
  - luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?
  ans:
  - we'il take that one.

- que:
  - you know of the rebellion against the empire?
  ans:
  - that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.

- que:
  - have you been in many battles?
  ans:
  - several, i think.

- que:
  - what is what?!?
  ans:
  - he asked you a question...

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - help me, obi wan kenobi.

- que:
  - who is she?
  ans:
  - she's beautiful.

- que:
  - is there more to this recording?
  ans:
  - behave yourself, artoo.

- que:
  - i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know anyone named obi wan, but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea.

- que:
  - play back the entire message.
  ans:
  - where'd she go?

- que:
  - you know, i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
  ans:
  - what message?

- que:
  - what makes you think that?
  ans:
  - well, i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him.

- que:
  - do you know what he's talking about?
  ans:
  - well, i wonder if he's related to ben.

- que:
  - he died about the same time as your father.
  ans:
  - but what if this obi wan comes looking for him?

- que:
  - he knew my father?
  ans:
  - i told you to forget it.

- que:
  - you mean the next semester before harvest?
  ans:
  - sure, there're more than enough droids.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - it looks like i'm going nowhere.

- que:
  - what are you doing hiding there?
  ans:
  - it wasn't my fault, sir.

- que:
  - how could i be so stupid?
  ans:
  - it's too dangerous with all the sandpeople around.

- que:
  - have you seen luke this morning?
  ans:
  - he said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.

- que:
  - did he take those two new droids with him?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - master luke here is your rightful owner.

- que:
  - what's wrong with him now?
  ans:
  - he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.

- que:
  - the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
  ans:
  - ben?

- que:
  - he claims to be the property of an obi wan kenobi.
  ans:
  - tell me young luke, what brings you out this far?

- que:
  - do you know who he's talking about?
  ans:
  - now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time... a long time.

- que:
  - do you know him?
  ans:
  - well of course, of course i know him.

- que:
  - where am i?
  ans:
  - i must have taken a bad step...

- que:
  - can you stand?
  ans:
  - we've got to get out of here before the sandpeople return.

- que:
  - what kind of talk is that?
  ans:
  - quickly, son... they're on the move.

- que:
  - you fought in the clone wars?
  ans:
  - yes, i was once a jedi knight the same as your father.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - your fathers lightsaber. his is the weapon of a jedi knight.

- que:
  - how did my father die?
  ans:
  - a young jedi named darth vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights.

- que:
  - the force?
  ans:
  - well, the force is what gives a jedi his power.

- que:
  - alderaan?
  ans:
  - i'm not going to alderaan.

- que:
  - how am i ever going to explain this?
  ans:
  - the regional governors now have direct control over their territories.

- que:
  - and what of the rebellion?
  ans:
  - the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

- que:
  - why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas?
  ans:
  - if they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.

- que:
  - how long have you had these droids?
  ans:
  - about three or four seasons.

- que:
  - do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'il take us to alderaan?
  ans:
  - your droids.

- que:
  - she's fast enough for you, old man.
  ans:
  - fast ship?

- que:
  - what's the cargo?
  ans:
  - only passengers.

- que:
  - some kind of local trouble?
  ans:
  - let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.

- que:
  - well, that's the trick, isn't it?
  ans:
  - and it's going to cost you something extra.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - you bet i could.

- que:
  - going somewhere, solo?
  ans:
  - yes, greedo.

- que:
  - do you think i had a choice?
  ans:
  - you can tell that to jabba.

- que:
  - what course shall we set?
  ans:
  - perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.

- que:
  - you didn't think i was going to run did you?
  ans:
  - han, my boy, there are times when you surprise me.

- que:
  - and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that, after all we're been throught together?
  ans:
  - look jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come and see me yourself.

- que:
  - where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment...... at the first sign of an imperial starship?
  ans:
  - it's not good business.

- que:
  - do you think i had a choice?
  ans:
  - i got a nice easy charter now.

- que:
  - why don't you outrun them?
  ans:
  - it'il take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer.

- que:
  - what's that flashing?
  ans:
  - we're losing our deflector shield.

- que:
  - so it'il be the last time.
  ans:
  - you would prefer another target?

- que:
  - where is the rebel base?
  ans:
  - dantooine.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're far too trusting.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i felt a great disturbance in the force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

- que:
  - you mean it controls your actions?
  ans:
  - partially.

- que:
  - you don't believe in the force, do you?
  ans:
  - kid, i've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to fight?
  ans:
  - your eyes can deceive you.

- que:
  - going good against the living?
  ans:
  - that's something else.

- que:
  - what the...?
  ans:
  - aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - thats what i'm trying to tell you, kid.

- que:
  - there aren't any bases around here.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - where did it come from?
  ans:
  - it sure is leaving in a big hurry.

- que:
  - several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
  ans:
  - why are we still moving towards it?

- que:
  - did you find any droids?
  ans:
  - the ship's all yours.

- que:
  - hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
  ans:
  - tx four one two.

- que:
  - tx four one two, do you copy?
  ans:
  - take over.

- que:
  - where did you dig up that old fossil?
  ans:
  - ben is a great man.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir.

- que:
  - well, who... who has he found?
  ans:
  - princess leia.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - level five.

- que:
  - rich?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - well more wealth that you can imagine.

- que:
  - uh... threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - where are you taking this... thing?
  ans:
  - prisoner transfer from block one one three eight.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - we're sending a squad up.

- que:
  - what's your operating number?
  ans:
  - oh... the uniform.

- que:
  - you're who?
  ans:
  - this is some rescue.

- que:
  - when you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
  ans:
  - he's the brains, sweetheart.

- que:
  - what the hell are you doing?
  ans:
  - i already tried it.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...

- que:
  - do you copy?
  ans:
  - shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - no, wait.

- que:
  - it's a wonder you're still alive.
  ans:
  - okay?

- que:
  - will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
  ans:
  - no reward is worth this.

- que:
  - do you know what's going on?
  ans:
  - maybe it's another drill.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - oh, it's nothing.

- que:
  - are you safe?
  ans:
  - for the moment.

- que:
  - you came in that thing?
  ans:
  - you're braver that i thought.

- que:
  - what good will it do us if he gets himself killed?
  ans:
  - i think we took a wrong turn.

- que:
  - what kept you?
  ans:
  - we ran into some old friends.

- que:
  - is the ship all right?
  ans:
  - seems okay, if we can get to it.

- que:
  - this is all your fault.
  ans:
  - you hear me, baby?

- que:
  - are they away?
  ans:
  - they have just made the jump into hyperspace.

- que:
  - you're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
  ans:
  - i'm taking an awful risk, vader.

- que:
  - not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
  ans:
  - you know, sometimes i even amaze myself.

- que:
  - at least the information in artoo is still intact.
  ans:
  - easy... you call that easy?

- que:
  - what's he carrying?
  ans:
  - the technical readouts of that battle station.

- que:
  - pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
  ans:
  - well, the empire doesn't consider a small one man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.

- que:
  - i got some old debts i've got to pay off with this stuff.
  ans:
  - so... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?

- que:
  - why don't you come with us?
  ans:
  - you know what's about to happen, what they're up against.

- que:
  - what good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
  ans:
  - besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.

- que:
  - what're you lookin 'at?
  ans:
  - i know what i'm doing.

- que:
  - are you sure you can handle this ship?
  ans:
  - sir, luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - i told you i'd make it someday, biggs.

- que:
  - that little droid and i have been through a lot together.
  ans:
  - do you want a new one?

- que:
  - you okay, artoo?
  ans:
  - good.

- que:

  ans:
  - what is a bell that does not ring... yet its knell makes the angels sing?

- que:
  - don't you care what's happened?

  ans:
  - higher, higher, burning fire.

- que:
  - did you think this a mere plaything?
  ans:
  - with it, my empire is eternal.

  ans:
  - ahh, a little sassafras.

- que:
  - you think me fair, do you, jack?

  ans:
  - sweeter than bee pollen... on a summer wind.

  - lily?
  ans:
  - yes, jack.

- que:
  - we meet back here in twice 500 beats of a bluebird's heart.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, bob, do you now have a problem with the script?
  ans:
  - no, no, no, the script is awesome, sir.

- que:
  - hey, bob, just cool it, okay?

  ans:
  - yeah, right.
