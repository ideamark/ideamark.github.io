  - yeah.

- que:
  - will you try it a little more subdued?
  ans:
  - s e e. see with your eyes.

- que:
  - and this?
  ans:
  - this is like my little window to the world, and every minute, it's a different show.

- que:
  - am i first?
  ans:
  - um, i don't know.

- que:
  - well, just just give me an address or something, okay?
  ans:
  - tell you what, go up three more streets, take a right, go two more blocks, drop this guy off on the next corner.

- que:
  - where's that?
  ans:
  - i don't know either, but it's somewhere, and it's gonna determine the course of the rest of your life.

- que:
  - but how do i know they understand?
  ans:
  - because words are inert.

- que:
  - they're dead, you know?
  ans:
  - and so much of our experience is intangible.

- que:
  - until what?
  ans:
  - until you reach a crescendo in a way... could be imagined as an enormous instantaneous fulfillment of human, human and neo human potential.

- que:
  - it's efficient, okay?
  ans:
  - and its manifestations are those social adaptations.

- que:
  - you're talking about parasitism, dominance, morality, okay?
  ans:
  - uh, war, predation, these would be subject to de emphasis.

- que:
  - hey, you got a match?
  ans:
  - and they haven't given us any other options... outside the occasional, purely symbolic, participatory act of voting.

- que:
  - i keep thinking about something you said.
  ans:
  - you want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?

- que:
  - something i said?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you remember that?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you know what i'm saying?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah, definitely.

- que:
  - then what would you be in all that?
  ans:
  - whatever i am right now.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - just about reincarnation and where all the new souls come from over time.

- que:
  - the world population has doubled in the past 40 years, right?
  ans:
  - so if you really believe in that ego thing of one eternal soul, mm hmm. then you only have a 50  chance of your soul being over 40.

- que:
  - reincarnation doesn't exist... or that we're all young souls like where half of us are first round humans?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - you know the best part?
  ans:
  - you'll see me bring that cigar closer and closer... to your wide open eyeball... till you're almost out of your mind.

- que:
  - what about quantum mechanics?
  ans:
  - i know enough contemporary physical theory to know it's not really like that.

- que:
  - should our freedom just be a matter of probabilities, just some random swerving in a chaotic system?
  ans:
  - resistance is not futile.

- que:
  - you know that thing benedict anderson says about identity?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why is world history and evolution not stories of progress... but rather this endless and futile addition of zeroes?
  ans:
  - no greater values have developed.

- que:
  - what are you writing?
  ans:
  - a novel.

- que:
  - what's the story?
  ans:
  - there's no story.

- que:
  - are you in the story?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - why don t you pull the trigger and find out?
  ans:
  - they say that dreams are real only as long as they last.

- que:
  - can't you say the same thing about life?
  ans:
  - a lot of us out there are mapping that mind/ body relationship of dreams.

- que:
  - did you ever have a job that you hated and worked real hard at?
  ans:
  - a long, hard day of work.

- que:
  - hey, man, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i fancy myself the social lubricator of the dream world, helping people become lucid a little easier.

- que:
  - by becoming lucid, you mean just knowing that you re dreaming, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so what was going on in your dream?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - i woke up wondering, where did all this stuff come from?
  ans:
  - you can control that.

- que:
  - do you have these dreams all the time?
  ans:
  - hell, yeah.

- que:
  - but that's one of the things you do to test if you re dreaming or not, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, like i said, you can totally train yourself to recognize it.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - oh, man, it's way ambitious, but i'm getting better at it.

- que:
  - pretty cool, huh?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what's that mean?
  ans:
  - well, you know, i never figured it out.

- que:
  - of a specific height who looks a certain way, right?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

- que:
  - you want me to get it for you?
  ans:
  - you got it.

- que:
  - i got it?
  ans:
  - but it's ridiculous.

- que:
  - well, you'd be in the moment.
  ans:
  - but who can live that way?

- que:
  - the moment is holy, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, but i'd be open.

- que:
  - why would you cry?
  ans:
  - for me, i just tend to cry.

- que:
  - everything is layers, isn't it?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - hey, old man, what you doing up there?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - you need any help getting down, sir?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think so.

- que:
  - why so glum, mr. deborg?
  ans:
  - what was missing was felt irretrievable.

- que:
  - you a dreamer?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - could we do that again?
  ans:
  - i know we haven't met, but i don't want to be an ant.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - stop.

- que:
  - you want ketchup with that?
  ans:
  - i don't want a straw.

- que:
  - i don't want to be an ant, you know?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, you wanna do it?
  ans:
  - uh, yeah.

- que:
  - i don't really know how to say it, but, um uh, what's it like to be a character in a dream?
  ans:
  - and i haven't even worn a watch since, like, fourth grade.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i i you know, i can't really remember right now.

- que:
  - what is your consistent perspective?
  ans:
  - i'm not in an objective, rational world.

- que:
  - like, right now i know that i'm dreaming, right?
  ans:
  - we're, like, even talking about it.

- que:
  - well, how do you feel?
  ans:
  - well, sometimes i feel kind of isolated, but most of the time, i feel really connected, really, like, engaged in this active process.

- que:
  - do you remember me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - at the station?
  ans:
  - you were on the pay phone and you looked at me... a few times.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - well, maybe not.

- que:
  - so doesn't it make sense that death, too, would be wrapped in dream?
  ans:
  - it would be the same dream body you experience in your everyday dream life.

- que:
  - a what?
  ans:
  - you gave me a ride in a car that was also a boat.

- que:
  - i remember and ferment the desire to remember everything.
  ans:
  - you know that cat that was just in here, who just ran out the door?

- que:
  - and i'm tired of cleaning up your little burrito doings.
  ans:
  - so, what did you say to that?

- que:
  - you dig me?
  ans:
  - they're like little wheels.

- que:
  - weren t you in the boat car?
  ans:
  - you know, the guy the guy with the hat.

- que:
  - but it sounds like what else are you gonna do, right?
  ans:
  - anyway, i read this essay by philip k..

- que:
  - what, you read it in your dream?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - you know that one?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - so that's really freaking him out, but what can he do?
  ans:
  - and shortly after that, he was going to mail a letter, and he saw this kind of, um, dangerous, shady looking guy standing by his car.

- que:
  - so this whole episode is kind of creepy, right?
  ans:
  - and he's telling his priest about it, describing how he wrote this book, and four years later, all these things happened to him.

- que:
  - it's no more 50 a. d. than it's 2001, you know?
  ans:
  - there's just this one instant, and that's what we're always in.

- que:
  - how did you finally get out of it?
  ans:
  - oh, man.

- que:
  - yeah, but how did you finally get out of the dream?
  ans:
  - see, that's my problem.

- que:
  - how do you really wake up?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - we could drive by to take you in the morning?
  ans:
  - ok.

- que:
  - see you tomorrow?
  ans:
  - great, short and sweet.

- que:
  - good news?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:

- que:
  - so, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - go to sleep.

- que:
  - that is all that he said?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - does he want me to turn from the right, or turn from the left?
  ans:
  - right side... with intensity.

- que:
  - is that everything?
  ans:
  - it seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.

- que:
  - how's tokyo?
  ans:
  - it is great here.

- que:
  - rather one has to let them be themselves, don't you think?
  ans:

- que:
  - who was it, myrtle?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - i just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes...... over there by that sink.

- que:
  - now, boys, what good will it do?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i m fine.

- que:
  - are you a ghost?
  ans:
  - a memory...... preserved in a diary for 50 years.

- que:
  - but why?
  ans:
  - because i told her to.

- que:
  - and then who should find it but you?

  ans:

- que:
  - haven't i told you?
  ans:
  - killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.

- que:
  - am i right, harry?
  ans:
  - it s just....

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue.

- que:
  - voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
  ans:
  - not intentionally...... but yes.

- que:
  - why, then, did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor?
  ans:
  - my sole concern has always been and will always be...... the welfare of this school...... and, of course, its students.

  - the culprit has been identified, i presume?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who was it?
  ans:
  - voldemort.

- que:
  - i wonder if i could have that?
  ans:
  - mr. malfoy.

- que:
  - mine?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - why don't you prove it?
  ans:
  - come, dobby.

- que:

  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - how can dobby ever repay him?
  ans:
  - just promise me something.

- que:
  - burden of command, correct?

- que:
  - now, haven't you punished yourself enough?
  ans:
  - what i did was wrong, jim.

- que:
  - for christ's sake, will you work with me?
  ans:

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - return to hangar.

- que:
  - you thought he was gonna try to take me hostage?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and how many years... did they take off your sentence for... that?
  ans:
  - four years, sir.

- que:
  - tell me, yates, how does a man like you... get into west point?

  ans:
  - crusade.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:

  - correct?
  ans:

  ans:
  - that's what i would do.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - well, i know what you're capable of.

- que:

- que:
  - now, haven't you punished yourself enough?
  ans:
  - what i did was wrong, jim.

- que:
  - for christ's sake, will you work with me?

  ans:
  - yes, you may.

- que:
  - do you understand me?

- que:
  - why are you here, yates?
  ans:
  - i would like your version.

- que:
  - you ran it, did you not?
  ans:
  - correct.

- que:
  - is that correct?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and how many years... did they take off your sentence for... that?
  ans:
  - four years, sir.

  ans:
  - yes, that is correct.

- que:
  - crusade?
  ans:
  - crusade.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's not my fight.

- que:
  - mr. irwin is in a fight?
  ans:
  - it says here you have three years...

- que:
  - correct?
  ans:
  - that's what it says.

- que:
  - does three months sound better?
  ans:
  - i need to resolve this situation... quickly... before someone else gets hurt... or killed.

- que:
  - do you agree?
  ans:
  - i guess.

- que:
  - how many times you gonna ask?
  ans:
  - stop your sniveling.

- que:
  - to succeed in a castle war, you have to overcome the garrison, take the high ground... and ultimately capture the flag.

- que:
  - general, i know, uh, his father served with you in vietnam, but do we really need him around?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you're in maintenance?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - got a minute?
  ans:
  - five to two, in the colonel's favour.

- que:

  ans:
  - somebody.

- que:
  - would hineman know?
  ans:
  - now listen, come in.

  - what?
  ans:
  - i'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this.

- que:

  - no, no, no.

- que:

- que:

  ans:
  - none of your business.

- que:
  - john?
  ans:
  - don't run.

- que:
  - got a grip?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - this just isn't your week, is it?
  ans:
  - chief anderton.

- que:
  - just what is it you think i can do for you?
  ans:
  - you could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.

- que:
  - how would i know that?
  ans:
  - because you invented precrime.

- que:
  - what's so funny?
  ans:
  - if the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...... can be called an invention, then i invented precrime.

- que:
  - heal who?
  ans:
  - the innocents we use to stop the guilty.

- que:
  - you think they came from a test tube?
  ans:
  - they are merely the ones who survived.

- que:
  - you say some of the children died?
  ans:
  - so many of them.

- que:
  - it's a perfect system now, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i'm not going to commit murder.

- que:
  - you won't help?
  ans:
  - i can't help you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - jesus christ.

- que:
  - why didn't i know about this?
  ans:
  - because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - for precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.

- que:
  - who wants a justice system that instills doubt?
  ans:
  - it may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

- que:
  - are you saying i've haloed innocent people?
  ans:
  - i'm saying that every so often, those accused of a precrime...... just might have an alternate future.

- que:
  - does burgess know about this, about this minority report?
  ans:
  - i used to joke with lamar that we were the parents of precrime.

- que:
  - does lamar burgess know about the minority report?
  ans:
  - yes, of course, he knew.

- que:
  - but what about those people that i put away with alternate futures?
  ans:
  - my god, if the country knew...

- que:
  - do you really?
  ans:
  - you wanna bring it down.

- que:
  - why should i trust you?
  ans:
  - you shouldn't trust anyone.

- que:
  - what safe place is that?
  ans:
  - the safest place there is.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - inside the pre cog who predicted it.

- que:
  - that's all, huh?
  ans:
  - just walk into precrime, get into the temple...... somehow tap into these pre cogs and download this minority report.

- que:
  - how do i even know which one has it?
  ans:
  - it's always in the more gifted of the three.

- que:
  - which one is that?
  ans:
  - the female.

- que:
  - why won't he just run?
  ans:
  - because he thinks he's innocent.

- que:
  - where is she?
  ans:
  - started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and i knew that.

- que:
  - you do understand i can't just give you new irises?
  ans:
  - please, don't touch.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - it's anesthesia.

- que:
  - you always sneak up on your patients?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because my mother gave them to me.

- que:
  - what's it to you?
  ans:
  - you can't resell them.

- que:
  - what did you give me?
  ans:
  - smile medicine.

  ans:
  - i had to ask.

- que:
  - he hasn't tried to contact you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did he ever mention the name leo crow?
  ans:
  - no, but i don't talk to john much anymore.

- que:
  - have you been there recently?
  ans:
  - it's full of these.

- que:
  - how long has he been doping?
  ans:
  - since right after we lost our son.

- que:
  - what was it then?
  ans:
  - the fbi found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.

- que:
  - so what?
  ans:

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - in the fridge, there's milk.

- que:

  ans:
  - it'll turn your pretty face into mush.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - 25.

- que:
  - is it a world record?
  ans:
  - it's a personal best.

- que:
  - how long can a whale hold its breath?
  ans:
  - for about 20 minutes.

- que:
  - you sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?
  ans:
  - because you know i'm gonna beat that whale.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - sean.

- que:
  - have you seen...?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for my son.

- que:
  - you seen my boy?
  ans:
  - he's wearing a red bathing suit.

- que:
  - you must really like me, don't you?
  ans:
  - that's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.

- que:
  - that you think i might, you know, futz with him?
  ans:
  - no, i just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.

- que:
  - four spyders, one per floor?
  ans:
  - let's do eight.

- que:
  - a drunk, maybe can't wake up?
  ans:
  - or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

- que:
  - four?
  ans:
  - there's anderton, crow and the man in sunglasses.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because precrime works.

- que:
  - can we see the pre cogs?
  ans:
  - they have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...... so as not to be distracted.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - easy there, old timer.

- que:
  - who cleared you?
  ans:
  - you're not allowed here.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - is there another way out of there?
  ans:
  - all the doors are covered.

- que:
  - what does he want with a pre cog?
  ans:
  - so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.

- que:
  - the other two can still function, right?
  ans:
  - they're a hive mind.

- que:
  - they can't see murders anymore?
  ans:
  - agatha, she's the key.

  ans:
  - six years ago, baltimore...... you grabbed a kid at francis public pool on the west end.

- que:

  ans:
  - i don't remember anything about that place.

- que:
  - do you know who i am?

- que:
  - how could you do that to my...?
  ans:

- que:
  - who's he?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - if you did what?
  ans:

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - there's something wrong.

- que:
  - you got this from containment?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - so the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
  ans:
  - danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - jad told me that sometimes the pre cogs see the same murder more than once.

- que:
  - what if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?
  ans:
  - i don't understand.

- que:
  - do you know what i hear?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - do you know why?
  ans:
  - because right now, the pre cogs can't see a thing.

- que:
  - can you see?
  ans:
  - it's beautiful.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - someplace safe.

- que:
  - is the pre cog with him?
  ans:
  - keep them there.

- que:
  - you just don't let john leave, all right?
  ans:
  - he's no killer, lamar.

- que:
  - you remember when i would read tom sawyer to you and sean?
  ans:
  - he got so scared when tom and becky were lost in the cave.

  ans:
  - because i found out about her.

- que:
  - seen what?
  ans:
  - anne lively.

- que:
  - can't you see?
  ans:
  - she just wanted her little girl back.

- que:
  - who killed anne lively?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, john, but you're gonna have to run again.

- que:
  - i was so worried about you.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - did he hurt you?
  ans:
  - i missed you so much.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - anne lively.

- que:
  - and witwer?
  ans:
  - he was killed with john's gun inside john's apartment.

- que:

  - jad, you getting this?
  ans:
  - it's from the female only.

- que:
  - what you up to, big man?
  ans:
  - think before you send that.

- que:
  - how can you kill her without the pre cogs seeing it?
  ans:
  - simple.

- que:
  - anne lively became just another missing person.
  ans:
  - where's my daughter?

- que:
  - you knew that would drive me to murder.
  ans:
  - so, what are you gonna do, lamar?

- que:
  - shut me up?
  ans:
  - forgive me, john.

- que:
  - the question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now?
  ans:
  - no doubt the pre cogs have already seen this.

- que:
  - you see the dilemma, don't you?
  ans:
  - if you don't kill me, pre cogs were wrong and precrime is over.

- que:
  - what's it worth?
  ans:
  - me too.

- que:
  - yeah... l mean... are you sure?

  ans:
  - i'm sorry, she's just upset.

- que:
  - lily, why would you saysomething like that?
  ans:
  - right before he died, i said it.

- que:
  - you said what?
  ans:
  - bloody mary, three times in the bathroom mirror.

- que:
  - your dad didn't say it, did he?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think so.

- que:
  - sam:the bloody mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?
  ans:
  - not that i know of.

- que:
  - the place where the legend began?
  ans:
  - but according to the legend, the person who says...

- que:
  - what are you doingup here?
  ans:
  - we... we had to go to the bathroom.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - like we said downstairs, we worked with donna's dad.

- que:
  - no, i know, i meant... and those weird questions downstairs, what was that?
  ans:
  - so you tell me what's going on or i start screaming.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - honestly, we don't know yet.

- que:
  - who are you, cops?
  ans:
  - something like that.

- que:
  - what are we supposed to be looking for?
  ans:
  - every version's got thingsin common.

- que:
  - you didn't think so?
  ans:
  - yeah, okay, they were cute.

- que:
  - but, still, do you think something could have happenedto donna's dad?
  ans:
  - maybe lily was right.

- que:
  - was that fear i hear in your voice?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you killed that boy.
  ans:
  - jill?

- que:
  - so, what did you dream about?
  ans:
  - lollipops and candy canes.

- que:
  - oh, besides a whole new level of frustration?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - and they found her on the bathroom floor.

- que:
  - i'm insane, right?
  ans:
  - no, you're not insane.

- que:
  - what did you tell jill's mom?
  ans:
  - i just said i needed some time alone with jill's pictures and things.

- que:
  - what are you guys looking for?
  ans:
  - we'll let you know as soon as we find it.

- que:
  - do i look like paris hilton?
  ans:
  - so, i don't get it.

- que:
  - how's she choosing them?
  ans:
  - beats me.

- que:
  - you know who that is?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - jill drove that car.

- que:
  - why are you asking me this?
  ans:
  - look, we're sorry, but it's important.

- que:
  - linda's my mom, okay?
  ans:
  - and she overdosed on sleeping pills.

- que:
  - do you really think her dad could have killed her mom?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - you're doing a nationwide search?
  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - why mary's choosing a victim?
  ans:
  - it seems like there's a pattern.

- que:
  - what exactly happened?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you know who it was?
  ans:
  - not for sure.

- que:
  - now, why would he do something like that?
  ans:
  - her diary mentioned a man she was seeing.

- que:
  - but how do you know it was sampson who killed her?
  ans:
  - it's hard to say.

- que:
  - but you could never prove it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is he still alive?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - where's she buried?
  ans:
  - she wasn't.

- que:
  - it's not in evidence lockup somewhere, is it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i mean, you bring these strangers into my house, and they ask me things like that?
  ans:
  - they were only trying to help.

- que:
  - about bloody mary?
  ans:
  - please, i know it sounds crazy.

- que:
  - but you?
  ans:
  - think about the way your dad died, okay, and the way jill died.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - nothing happened.

- que:
  - why would you do that?
  ans:
  - ah, that's too bad, mr. worthington.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - so, that was mary's brother.

- que:
  - so wherever the mirror goes, that's where mary goes?
  ans:
  - her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.

- que:
  - isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?
  ans:
  - yeah, there is.

- que:
  - maybe.
  ans:
  - yeah, but how could she move through 100 different mirrors?

- que:
  - charlie?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - it's okay, all right?
  ans:
  - now, listen.

- que:
  - i'm gonna die, aren't i?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can you tell us about it?
  ans:
  - i had this boyfriend.

- que:
  - but he kind of scared me, too, you know?
  ans:
  - and... one night at his house, we got in this fight.

- que:
  - and you know what i said?
  ans:
  - and i left.

- que:
  - how could i leave him like that?
  ans:
  - i just...

- que:
  - i didn't believe him, you know?
  ans:
  - i should have.

- que:
  - mary's hard to pin down, right?
  ans:
  - and she moves around from mirror to mirror.

- que:
  - so, who's to say that she's not gonna just keep hiding in them forever?
  ans:
  - so maybe... we should try to pin her down, you know, summon her to her mirror and then smash it.

- que:
  - i'm not for sure.
  ans:
  - well, how do you know that's gonna work?

- que:
  - well, who's gonnasummon her?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - all right, you know what?
  ans:
  - that's it.

- que:
  - you think that's your dirty little secret, that you killed her somehow?
  ans:
  - sam, this has got to stop, man.

- que:
  - or, hell, why don't you take a swing at me?
  ans:
  - i'm the one that dragged you away from her the first place.

- que:
  - i don't what?
  ans:
  - you don't know all about it.

- que:
  - it wouldn't really be a secret if i told you, would it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who knows how many more people are gonna die after that?
  ans:
  - now, we're doing this.

- que:
  - you sure about this?
  ans:
  - bloody mary.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm the boss's kid.

- que:
  - you're mr. yamashiro's kid?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - but it's more than that, isn't it?
  ans:
  - those nightmares you've been having of jessica dying, screaming, burning you had them for days before she died.

- que:
  - it's sam.
  ans:
  - how could you ignore them like that?

- que:
  - god, are you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah, it's over.

- que:
  - charlie?
  ans:
  - your boyfriend's death, you really should try to forgive yourself.

- que:
  - no, i got to findjessica's killer.
  ans:
  - hey, sam?

- que:
  - um... oh, god. too martha stewart?
  ans:
  - here, wear this.

- que:
  - i'd think you brought me hereon purpose.
  ans:
  - so?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm offended.

- que:
  - do you want to get that?
  ans:
  - definitely not.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - just wait here.
  ans:
  - what is that?

- que:
  - what the hell?
  ans:
  - okay.

  ans:
  - not just somebody lori sorenson.

- que:
  - who's lori sorenson?
  ans:
  - you missed a spotdown on the back.

- que:
  - you wouldn't happen to knowwhich church, would you?
  ans:
  - and now, as time healsall our wounds, we should reflect onwhat this tragedy means to us as a church. h...

- que:
  - what have we got on the spacecraft that's good?
  ans:
  - i'll get back to you, gene.

- que:
  - flight?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what the hell good is that gonna do?
  ans:
  - lf that's where the leak is, we can isolate it there... and we can save what's left in the tanks and run on the good cell.

- que:
  - did i hear you right?
  ans:
  - yeah, they heard me right.

- que:
  - do you copy, jim?
  ans:
  - yes, houston, we copy.

- que:
  - freddo, how long does it take to power up the lem?
  ans:
  - three hours by the checklist.

- que:
  - can you give me a number?
  ans:
  - we're looking at less than 15 minutes of life support in the odyssey.

- que:
  - are you back with me now?
  ans:
  - aquarius, this is houston.

- que:
  - we've got negative visibility in our star field, and if this paperwork isn't right, who knows where we'll end up out here?
  ans:
  - looks good, flight.

- que:
  - ls it swigert?
  ans:
  - three million fewer viewers watched the space shot than did the last one.

- que:
  - what do you mean there's no immediate danger?
  ans:
  - i just heard they're losing oxygen.

- que:
  - can they get back?
  ans:
  - the lem's descent rocket engine will be used in aborting the mission... and getting the astronauts safely back to earth.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why can't i null this out?
  ans:
  - she wasn't designed to fly attached like this.

- que:
  - you want us to go to vox?
  ans:
  - you have a hot mike.

- que:
  - marilyn?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - why are so many people here?
  ans:
  - oh, well, you know... your dad's flying his mission.

- que:
  - was it the door?
  ans:
  - thirteen, houston.

- que:
  - how you doing?
  ans:
  - houston, aquarius.

- que:
  - do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?
  ans:
  - it's gonna get awfully cold in here.

- que:
  - did they shut us all down in there?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - houston, how far off course do you project we are?
  ans:
  - over.

- que:
  - how do we get our people home?
  ans:
  - they are here.

- que:
  - we designed the lem to land on the moon, not fire the engine out there for course corrections.
  ans:
  - straight back?

- que:
  - well, unfortunately, we're not landing on the moon, are we?
  ans:
  - i don't care what anything was designed to do.

- que:
  - let's lay it out, okay?
  ans:
  - capcom.

- que:
  - do we know how long we're gonna fire that burn?
  ans:
  - he specifically wanted a quote from a flight director.

- que:
  - who wanted a quote?
  ans:
  - the president.

- que:
  - the president?
  ans:
  - nixon.

- que:
  - three to one?
  ans:
  - look, tell him... three to one.

- que:
  - you wanna look?
  ans:
  - oh, look at that.

- que:
  - gentlemen, what are your intentions?
  ans:
  - i'd like to go home.

- que:
  - so you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?
  ans:
  - that brings them to about there.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - without it, they don't talk to us, they don't correct their trajectory, they don't turn the heat shield around.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - you can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, john.

- que:
  - what if they need to do another burn?
  ans:
  - they won't even know which way they're pointed.

- que:
  - that's the deal?
  ans:
  - that's the deal.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - good, you're not dead.

- que:
  - jesus, john, what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i gotta get you in the simulators.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - there's been an explosion.

- que:
  - what about the crew?
  ans:
  - crew's fine so far.

- que:
  - how much power do we have to play with?
  ans:
  - barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours.

- que:
  - ken, you know what's going on?
  ans:
  - john's brought me up to speed.

- que:
  - what do we have left in the batteries?
  ans:
  - we don't really know.

- que:
  - you know how short?
  ans:
  - it's all in the sequencing.

- que:
  - you started on a procedure?
  ans:
  - the engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - no more waste dumps.

- que:
  - ls it a. m. or p. m.?
  ans:
  - a. m. very, very a. m.

- que:
  - could you sleep up there?
  ans:
  - it's gonna get cold in there for them.

- que:
  - what about the scrubbers on the command module?
  ans:
  - they take square cartridges.

- que:
  - don't you ever sleep?
  ans:
  - i have a request from the news people.

- que:
  - transmitter?
  ans:
  - look, i, um, realize how hard this is, marilyn, but the whole world is caught up in it.

- que:
  - it could cost us amp hours on the back end?
  ans:
  - that's a possibility.

- que:
  - have they called up with a reentry plan yet?
  ans:
  - hold on.

- que:
  - how'd you figure that?
  ans:
  - i can add.

- que:
  - what are you saying, fred?
  ans:
  - i think you know what i'm saying.

- que:
  - aquarius, this is houston.
  ans:
  - what was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?

- que:
  - are we on vox?
  ans:
  - no, we're not on vox.

- que:
  - yeah, jim, could you check your co2 gauge for us?
  ans:
  - yeah, houston, we were just looking at that.

- que:
  - what do we do about it?
  ans:
  - we're working on a procedure down here for you.

- que:
  - do you copy?
  ans:
  - oh, christ.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - that's what they gotta make.

- que:
  - that's it?
  ans:
  - all right, aquarius, this is houston.

- que:
  - do you have a flight plan?
  ans:
  - affirmative, andy.

- que:
  - what about their level of carbon dioxide?
  ans:
  - it's, uh, climbing.

- que:
  - you're saying that they're almost out of breathable air?
  ans:
  - wait a second.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - they just tore the bag.

- que:
  - so how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you've faced?
  ans:
  - i'd have to say that this is the most serious situation... we've ever encountered in manned space flight.

- que:
  - which one has the leak?
  ans:
  - don't know that yet, john.

- que:
  - you need a break, ken?
  ans:
  - lf they don't get one, i don't get one.

- que:
  - are you scared?
  ans:
  - well, don't you worry, honey.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - something about another course correction.

- que:
  - without the computer, what do we use for orientation?
  ans:
  - we've got to be able to give these guys something.

- que:
  - houston, what's the story with this burn?
  ans:
  - we're trying to hash something out down here, aquarius.

- que:
  - ls that not correct?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can they fly it manually and still shut it down... on time without the computer?
  ans:
  - i guess that's the best we can do.

- que:
  - it will ignite, will it not?
  ans:
  - i just want you to know the engine's never been tried like this.

- que:
  - you up to this, freddo?
  ans:
  - guess you can keep your job.

- que:
  - well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?
  ans:
  - you're telling me what you need.

- que:
  - ls there an instance in an airplane emergency when you can recall fear?
  ans:
  - i remember one time, i'm in a banshee at night in combat conditions, so there's no running lights on the carrier.

- que:
  - how's it going, fred?
  ans:
  - i'm okay.

- que:
  - what the hell was that?
  ans:
  - let's hope it was just the burst disk.

- que:
  - houston, can you confirm a burst helium disk?
  ans:
  - we confirm that.

- que:
  - houston, is that going to affect our, uh, entry angle at all?
  ans:
  - uh, negative.

- que:
  - when can we expect that?
  ans:
  - uh, that's coming real soon, aquarius.

- que:
  - what's the story?
  ans:
  - we're gonna get that power up procedure to you.

- que:
  - ken's working on it?
  ans:
  - look...

- que:
  - by how much?
  ans:
  - four.

- que:
  - we know they have some power left in the lem batteries, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - do we have a procedure for that?
  ans:
  - you're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, ken.

- que:
  - how am i reading?
  ans:
  - fine, so far.

- que:
  - ken?
  ans:
  - go ahead.

- que:
  - ls your computer on now?
  ans:
  - up and running.

- que:
  - john?
  ans:
  - i think we got it, buddy.

- que:
  - arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?
  ans:
  - excuse me, gentlemen.

- que:
  - was it tried on the hardware yet?
  ans:
  - we didn't have time.

- que:
  - do you read?
  ans:
  - yeah, we read you, ken.

- que:
  - are the flowers blooming in houston?
  ans:
  - uh, that's a negative, jim.

- que:
  - jim, is jack in there with you?
  ans:
  - uh, yeah, stand by one.

- que:
  - are you boys in the space program too?
  ans:
  - okay, jack, give me a read back on that last procedure.

- que:
  - what's the word on these things shorting out?
  ans:
  - uh, we'll just take that one at a time, jack.

- que:
  - now how could they be underweight?
  ans:
  - we didn't land on the moon.

- que:
  - rocks?
  ans:
  - that's affirm.

- que:
  - ballast?
  ans:
  - um, that's affirm.

- que:
  - okay, ken, uh, uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?
  ans:
  - that's affirm.

- que:
  - can you see that?
  ans:
  - oh, man, that's incredible.

- que:
  - did jim make eagle scout or not?
  ans:
  - yes, he did.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i'm, uh i'm freezing.

- que:
  - can you hold out just a little longer?
  ans:
  - long as i have to.

- que:
  - ls everyone strapped in, ken?
  ans:
  - we're getting real close.

- que:
  - have you got everybody in the odyssey?
  ans:
  - yeah, ken, i'm gonna check those pyro batteries one more time here.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - oh, i was getting a little punchy, and i didn't want to cut the lem loose with you guys still in it.

- que:
  - mary?
  ans:
  - it's almost time, honey.

- que:
  - okay, but now i'm asking you, when will we know?
  ans:
  - well, blackout lasts for three minutes.

- que:
  - fred, how are the batteries looking?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - ls there anything we can do about it?
  ans:
  - not now, flight.

- que:
  - then they don't need to know, do they?
  ans:
  - copy that.

- que:
  - retro says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry?
  ans:
  - lf it doesn't, there'll only be silence.

- que:
  - do you read me?
  ans:
  - odyssey, this is houston.

- que:
  - do you read?
  ans:
  - expected time of reacquisition, the time when the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout, has come and gone.

- que:
  - do you read me?
  ans:
  - odyssey, houston.

- que:
  - do you read?
  ans:
  - three minutes, 30 seconds.

- que:
  - do you read?
  ans:
  - odyssey, this is houston.

- que:
  - do you read me?
  ans:
  - that's four minutes.

- que:
  - do you read?
  ans:
  - hello, houston, this is odyssey.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - it's my gun.

- que:
  - your gun?
  ans:
  - don't hurt me.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - do that thing again.

- que:
  - who wants a beer?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - you and me?
  ans:
  - you and me are like this.

- que:
  - look, just because you're moving up to homicide, don't take me off your speed dial, ok?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna miss you.

- que:
  - what the fuck is this, the peanut gallery?
  ans:
  - god.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - oh, nothing.

- que:
  - what precinct?
  ans:
  - have it your way, stranger.

- que:
  - hi.
  ans:
  - you wanna dance?

- que:
  - hey, how you doing?
  ans:
  - back up, boys, you're breathing my air.

- que:
  - what's up, commissioner?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - i think i'd be getting a promotion too.
  ans:
  - leo, how you doing?

- que:
  - yeah, is that right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - well, you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm just here to have a good time, man.

- que:
  - or is it that you just can't do it?
  ans:
  - i could do it.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm off duty, man.

- que:
  - shepard?
  ans:
  - go.

- que:
  - you pass the written?
  ans:
  - yeah, of course.

- que:
  - how could i not?
  ans:
  - trained by the master.

- que:
  - really, grasshopper?
  ans:
  - well, the master is amazed at how badly you almost fucked it up.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - well, a moment ago, you demonstrated you still know how to process a room.

- que:
  - so tell me this, how did that psycho get a knife to your throat?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - copy that?
  ans:
  - copy.

- que:
  - i mean, what kind of moron tries to flush body parts down a toilet, especially when he's got a perfectly good furnace out back?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna head out.

- que:
  - where you been hiding?
  ans:
  - this is your night.

- que:
  - everything all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - panic attacks?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - let's get something straight.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - unless i'm convinced a crime is about to be committed or you are a danger to yourself.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - you're hoping i have some big problems.

- que:
  - so you did kick culter?
  ans:
  - hands break, feet don't.

- que:
  - what's once in a while?
  ans:
  - oh, you've got to be kidding me.

- que:
  - do i look like the kidding type?
  ans:
  - delmarco.

- que:
  - so how come you didn't say anything in the bar last night?
  ans:
  - i couldn't.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - i mean, isn't that some form of entrapment?
  ans:
  - then she handcuffs me, i'm down on my knees.

- que:
  - come on, isn't there some law against police brutality, sir?
  ans:
  - i'm going through a lot of pain and suffering, mr. porter.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - i know your little dirty side.

- que:
  - is that a problem?
  ans:
  - raymond porter.

- que:
  - ever make a mistake?
  ans:
  - yeah, you know what i'm talking about.

- que:
  - would you excuse us?
  ans:
  - i need to speak with jessica for a minute.

- que:
  - maybe you know someone who could help you with that?
  ans:
  - i think about that night.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - i guess culter did impact my life.

- que:
  - do i pass?
  ans:
  - well, almost.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - i barely remember my parents.

- que:
  - what's your secret?
  ans:
  - jessica, listen to me.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - be outside.

- que:
  - how are you, wilson?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - you remember wilson, my old patrol partner?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - any signs of cause of death?
  ans:
  - i don't know, man.

- que:
  - what's the score?
  ans:
  - we're up three, top of the fifth.

- que:
  - ok, what have we got here?
  ans:
  - let's take a look.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - we should check the tide charts.

- que:
  - hey, lopez, my key still good?
  ans:
  - yeah, mike.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - don't sweat it, you'll get used to it.

- que:
  - nothing more you can tell us?
  ans:
  - i told you, i don't really know the guy.

- que:
  - but you said you were intimate?
  ans:
  - i picked up a stranger in a bar and had sex with him.

- que:
  - you ever picked up a woman in a bar, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - yeah, in my fantasy life.

- que:
  - what is she, a suspect?
  ans:
  - come on, we got the call.

- que:
  - shepard?
  ans:
  - we'll talk later.

- que:
  - you live there?
  ans:
  - you're one big surprise after another, stranger.

- que:
  - you up for finding out who done it?
  ans:
  - ok, inspector, back to work.

- que:
  - well, i assume you checked the victim's cuffs last night, right?
  ans:
  - i also assume that you would've seen there was sand inside those cuffs, which tells us...

- que:
  - delmarco, shepard, where are you guys on yours?
  ans:
  - crime scene is clean.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - all right, let's break it up.

- que:
  - spotlight withdrawal?
  ans:
  - here's some advice i like to share with new inspectors.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - your boyfriend.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - bridge patrol found another floater.

- que:
  - how much did we drink last night?
  ans:
  - well, maybe next time you should go easy on the sangria.

- que:
  - big inspector now, so you don't call me back ever, right?
  ans:
  - i guess that's the reason.

- que:
  - you patrol guys wanna rustle me up some breakfast?
  ans:
  - a little bacon, eggs, toast, black coffee.

- que:
  - how's that?
  ans:
  - right there.

- que:
  - how did you know there'd be another body?
  ans:
  - there was that cigarette burn on the back of the hand.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - could be the killer's.

- que:
  - at one point, you did suffer from some stress related symptoms.
  ans:
  - how soon will you know?

- que:
  - is that what you've got there?
  ans:
  - my parents had died and i was sad.

- que:
  - what if you're in danger?
  ans:
  - fucking phone.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah...... just a few rats under the car.

- que:
  - you know what i mean?
  ans:
  - you know, sometimes i wonder if maybe i hadn't told him about her.

- que:
  - inspector shepard as a suspect?
  ans:
  - that's very funny, dale.

- que:
  - i mean, we know she slept with victim number one, right?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - so do we know if she slept with victim number two?
  ans:
  - i mean, shit, shepard, he is kind of cute.

- que:
  - you wanna know the punch line?
  ans:
  - i did sleep with victim number two.

- que:
  - why the hell did you do something like that?
  ans:
  - listen, brother, it is none of your business who i sleep with.

- que:
  - anyone got, like, a sick fixation on you, might be stalking you?
  ans:
  - lately, i've...... sort of felt like i'm being watched.

- que:
  - do we pull her off the case?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - backing you up?
  ans:
  - i was just giving my professional opinion.

- que:
  - just what the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - i'm not doing anything.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, that's not what i hear.

- que:
  - and what's going on with you and this delmarco genius?
  ans:
  - for god's sake, john.

- que:
  - is that why people keep dying around you?
  ans:
  - nice.

- que:
  - did i say that out loud?
  ans:
  - hey, i know you.

- que:
  - you're a cop?
  ans:
  - i don't believe it.

- que:
  - who'd you see him with?
  ans:
  - look, the only person i've ever seen that guy leave the bar with, aside from his girlfriend, was you.

- que:
  - did mr. geber have many regular visitors?
  ans:
  - the last person i saw him with looked a lot like you.

- que:
  - you find out anything up there?
  ans:
  - we just wasted the entire day tracking down me.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm kidding.

- que:
  - don't you miss me just a little?
  ans:
  - i miss you.

- que:
  - how many times do we have to go over it?
  ans:
  - you know, it just...

- que:
  - jim...
  ans:
  - you know what?

- que:
  - when did you first find out?
  ans:
  - when did you realize...

- que:
  - to take a human life?
  ans:
  - you know, we all have it in us.

- que:
  - what the hell are you doing here with my client?
  ans:
  - a little police work.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - you don't have to have a hissy fit, ray.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - only in my presence.

- que:
  - i am not having a hissy fit, ok?
  ans:
  - i am protecting my client's interests here.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what did i do?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - what the hell is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - well, i will explain it to you in detail.

- que:
  - so we have our killer's blood?
  ans:
  - well, the bad news is, he wasn't in the system.

- que:
  - that's all, huh?
  ans:

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - you're hoping i have some big problems.

- que:
  - so you did kick culter?
  ans:

- que:
  - what's once in a while?
  ans:
  - oh, you've got to be kidding me.

- que:
  - do i look like the kidding type?
  ans:
  - delmarco.

- que:
  - so how come you didn't say anything in the bar last night?
  ans:
  - i couldn't.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - i mean, isn't that some form of entrapment?
  ans:
  - then she handcuffs me, i'm down on my knees.

- que:
  - come on, isn't there some law against police brutality, sir?
  ans:
  - i'm going through a lot of pain and suffering, mr. porter.

- que:

  ans:
  - raymond porter.

- que:

  ans:
  - i think about that night.

- que:
  - right?
  ans:
  - i guess culter did impact my life.

- que:
  - do i pass?
  ans:
  - well, almost.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - i barely remember my parents.

- que:
  - hello?

- que:
  - you remember wilson, my old patrol partner?
  ans:
  - hi.

- que:
  - any signs of cause of death?
  ans:
  - i don't know, man.

- que:
  - what's the score?
  ans:
  - we're up three, top of the fifth.

- que:
  - ok, what have we got here?
  ans:
  - let's take a look.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - we should check the tide charts.

- que:
  - hey, lopez, my key still good?
  ans:
  - yeah, mike.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - don't sweat it, you'll get used to it.

- que:
  - nothing more you can tell us?
  ans:
  - i told you, i don't really know the guy.

- que:
  - but you said you were intimate?
  ans:
  - i picked up a stranger in a bar and had sex with him.

- que:
  - you ever picked up a woman in a bar, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - yeah, in my fantasy life.

- que:
  - what is she, a suspect?
  ans:
  - come on, we got the call.

- que:
  - shepard?
  ans:
  - we'll talk later.

- que:
  - you live there?
  ans:
  - you're one big surprise after another, stranger.

- que:
  - you up for finding out who done it?
  ans:
  - ok, inspector, back to work.

- que:
  - well, i assume you checked the victim's cuffs last night, right?
  ans:
  - i also assume that you would've seen there was sand inside those cuffs, which tells us...

- que:
  - delmarco, shepard, where are you guys on yours?
  ans:
  - crime scene is clean.

- que:
  - anything else?
  ans:
  - all right, let's break it up.

- que:
  - spotlight withdrawal?
  ans:
  - here's some advice i like to share with new inspectors.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - your boyfriend.

- que:
  - ok.
  ans:
  - jessica, yeah?

- que:
  - how much did we drink last night?
  ans:
  - well, maybe next time you should go easy on the sangria.

- que:
  - big inspector now, so you don't call me back ever, right?
  ans:
  - i guess that's the reason.

- que:
  - you patrol guys wanna rustle me up some breakfast?
  ans:
  - a little bacon, eggs, toast, black coffee.

- que:
  - how's that?
  ans:
  - right there.

- que:
  - how did you know there'd be another body?
  ans:
  - there was that cigarette burn on the back of the hand.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - could be the killer's.

- que:
  - at one point, you did suffer from some stress related symptoms.
  ans:
  - how soon will you know?

- que:
  - is that what you've got there?
  ans:
  - my parents had died and i was sad.

- que:
  - what if you're in danger?
  ans:
  - fucking phone.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah...... just a few rats under the car.

- que:
  - you know what i mean?
  ans:
  - you know, sometimes i wonder if maybe i hadn't told him about her.

- que:
  - inspector shepard as a suspect?
  ans:
  - that's very funny, dale.

- que:
  - i mean, we know she slept with victim number one, right?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - so do we know if she slept with victim number two?
  ans:
  - i mean, shit, shepard, he is kind of cute.

- que:
  - you wanna know the punch line?
  ans:
  - i did sleep with victim number two.

- que:
  - why the hell did you do something like that?
  ans:
  - listen, brother, it is none of your business who i sleep with.

- que:
  - anyone got, like, a sick fixation on you, might be stalking you?
  ans:
  - lately, i've...... sort of felt like i'm being watched.

- que:
  - do we pull her off the case?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - backing you up?
  ans:
  - i was just giving my professional opinion.

- que:
  - just what the hell do you think you're doing?
  ans:
  - i'm not doing anything.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, that's not what i hear.

- que:
  - and what's going on with you and this delmarco genius?
  ans:
  - for god's sake, john.

- que:
  - is that why people keep dying around you?
  ans:
  - nice.

- que:
  - did i say that out loud?
  ans:
  - hey, i know you.

- que:
  - you're a cop?
  ans:
  - i don't believe it.

- que:
  - who'd you see him with?
  ans:
  - look, the only person i've ever seen that guy leave the bar with, aside from his girlfriend, was you.

- que:
  - did mr. geber have many regular visitors?
  ans:
  - the last person i saw him with looked a lot like you.

- que:
  - you find out anything up there?
  ans:
  - we just wasted the entire day tracking down me.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i'm kidding.

- que:
  - don't you miss me just a little?
  ans:
  - i miss you.

- que:
  - how many times do we have to go over it?
  ans:
  - you know, it just...

- que:
  - jim...
  ans:
  - you know what?

- que:
  - when did you first find out?
  ans:
  - when did you realize...

- que:
  - to take a human life?
  ans:
  - you know, we all have it in us.

- que:
  - what the hell are you doing here with my client?
  ans:
  - a little police work.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - you don't have to have a hissy fit, ray.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - only in my presence.

- que:
  - i am not having a hissy fit, ok?
  ans:
  - i am protecting my client's interests here.

- que:
  - oh, yeah?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what did i do?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - what the hell is that supposed to mean?
  ans:
  - well, i will explain it to you in detail.

- que:
  - so we have our killer's blood?
  ans:
  - well, the bad news is, he wasn't in the system.

- que:
  - that's all, huh?
  ans:
  - hey, that's why they pay you homicide guys the big bucks.

- que:
  - bring your good pal lisa a little blood sample, will you?
  ans:
  - and i, one of law and order's little people, will burn the midnight oil, doing the task, making the match that will lock that fucker up.

- que:
  - and you get all the glory, and what, do you ask, do i get?
  ans:
  - hey, perhaps a dinner at chez panisse.

- que:
  - still going over all those unanswered questions?
  ans:
  - you got something to say to me, becker, quit being such a pussy and come out and say it.

- que:
  - including the doses of strychnine... she gave her preschool class.
  ans:

  ans:
  - hey, i saw you.

- que:
  - drake, are you still here?
  ans:
  - i could use help.

- que:
  - take your pills if you want to get better.
  ans:
  - once again, alice... are you going to do what your caretaker is requesting of you?

- que:
  - doesn't that make sense, sweetheart?
  ans:
  - i'm going to ask that you take your medication... or i'm afraid i'll have to resort to disciplinary measures.

- que:
  - it's late for you, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it wants me to go to sleep now.

- que:
  - why don't you come out?
  ans:
  - hey, kid, come on.

- que:
  - dr. morton, how long have you worked here?
  ans:
  - i've worked here for 27 years.

- que:
  - that were you doing down there after hours?
  ans:
  - i followed the little boy.

- que:
  - that noise i keep hearing, what is that?
  ans:
  - it sounds like it comes from the basement.

- que:
  - i figured it was the water pipes?
  ans:
  - maybe.

- que:
  - well, what is it?
  ans:
  - it's an old building.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - a while back... we had a patient down in cell 44.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - he jumped out a third story window.

- que:
  - did he die?
  ans:
  - some say he died when he hit the ground.

- que:
  - you believe that?
  ans:
  - either that or he came back to run this place.

- que:
  - if you're not too busy, perhaps you could mop it up?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - and?
  ans:
  - and i got to the rec room and realized she didn't need help... being that she was using a taser on a patient.

- que:
  - are you aware there are children running around here at night?
  ans:
  - no one gets in or out without my authorization.

- que:
  - what about the patient that escaped from the basement?
  ans:
  - dr. morton told me about... a patient who escaped.

- que:
  - look, let's start over again, all right?
  ans:
  - while it's no secret this place could use fixing up... most of the patients housed here are content.

- que:
  - you know why?
  ans:
  - they have no place else to go.

- que:
  - are we in agreement, mr. stevens?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - what are you trying to pull here?
  ans:
  - i have no idea what you're talking about.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm on my way back to my room.

- que:
  - do you want to sit in on an obsessive compulsive group... at 3:30?
  ans:
  - it's my own little session.

- que:
  - why, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - i'm a dork?
  ans:
  - you're a dork.

- que:
  - everyone in bed?
  ans:
  - all tucked in.

- que:
  - i don't have time to waste and i don't want to hurt you.
  ans:
  - is there something we can help you with?

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - you are only hurting yourself.

- que:
  - dr. morton?
  ans:
  - get dr. shores, take the west wing.

- que:
  - did you see anyone?
  ans:
  - we heard someone in the hall... and she went to check it out.

- que:
  - tight as a drum.
  ans:
  - they think a patient did it?

- que:
  - are you dating sara?
  ans:
  - i'll teach this freak to show respect.

- que:
  - why won't you talk to me?
  ans:
  - it might help you sort things out.

- que:
  - how does it feel to be convinced something is there... when logic tells you it's not?
  ans:
  - i thought i was hearing things.

- que:
  - why are you sitting in the dark?
  ans:
  - lilumination only reminds me of what i've become.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - that's a subjective question.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - bad things going down here.

- que:
  - what kind of bad things?
  ans:
  - take that sick individual lurking around, for instance.

- que:
  - who do you think it is?
  ans:
  - you're a smart boy, you'll figure it out.

- que:
  - is it you?
  ans:
  - the top of the food chain would be a good place to start looking.

- que:
  - are you speaking of dr. franks?
  ans:
  - they're cell numbers on a prescription to me.

- que:
  - can you tell me what the patient in cell 44 was diagnosed with?
  ans:
  - i just keep them doped up.

- que:
  - do you know what medication he's on?
  ans:
  - you sure have a lot of questions.

- que:
  - have you seen the place?
  ans:
  - thank you, grace.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - taking what the patients say seriously.

- que:
  - why are all the patients in the basement... on the same medication?
  ans:
  - because i'm sure they're keeping them seriously tranquilized.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - i started seeing stuff.

- que:
  - what makes you feel scared?
  ans:
  - it won't stop scaring me.

- que:
  - what won't?
  ans:
  - i try to close my eyes, make it go away.

- que:
  - what ghost?
  ans:
  - the one that runs through the house at night.

- que:
  - what does it want from you?
  ans:
  - to make sure that i never forget what madness feels like.

- que:
  - did i awake you?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - why did you stop talking to me last time i was down here?
  ans:
  - i'd run out of things to say.

- que:
  - why don't you come into the light where i can see you?
  ans:
  - come on, we're friends by now.

- que:
  - can you get out of this cell?
  ans:
  - only if someone lets me.

- que:
  - now who's talking in circles?
  ans:
  - clark, i've got sara on line one out here.

- que:
  - we'll continue this conversation later?
  ans:
  - you can call me ben.

- que:
  - what will the patients say?
  ans:
  - i think it's a little late for that.

- que:
  - so, did you finish up your interviews?
  ans:
  - basically.

- que:
  - what are you taking?
  ans:
  - oh, i have a cold.

- que:

  ans:
  - half hour ago.

- que:
  - other than himself?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what did you give him?
  ans:
  - what i always do.

- que:
  - are we starting with q& a again?
  ans:
  - because i don't have time.

- que:
  - grace, i'm sorry, what did you give him?
  ans:
  - i gave him his usual dose of happy tabs.

- que:
  - does it help?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't know.

- que:
  - but, ben, why don't you take it?
  ans:
  - they wouldn't help me if i did.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - a hospital is a place of business.

- que:
  - they give patients weak medication to keep them sick?
  ans:
  - look around you.

- que:
  - did i say something happened to him?
  ans:
  - i can't believe you talked me into this.

- que:
  - why are we doing this?
  ans:
  - i'll send the pills to a friend who works at the university hospital.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're cute when you're sleuthing.

- que:
  - sara?
  ans:
  - there is no place like home.

- que:
  - you're sure he isn't?
  ans:
  - no way.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's just between your theories on the medication, and franks.

- que:
  - now you're seeing ghosts?
  ans:
  - maybe your surroundings are affecting you.

- que:
  - where do they keep the patient records?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - franks found her taser in his things.

- que:
  - clark, you're there?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, yes, this is he.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - just placebos.

- que:
  - taking matters into our own hands?
  ans:
  - very aggressive.

- que:
  - how do you know about everything going on here?
  ans:
  - i'm smart.

- que:
  - why do you get out and i don't?
  ans:
  - only in my mind, royce.

  - let me put it this way, mr. amer.

- que:
  - hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...... by your dependence on people to carry out actions?

  ans:
  - lts pretty close to what you said about him earlier.

- que:
  - do you believe that hal has genuine emotions?

  - what is it, hal?
  ans:
  - weve got the transmission from your parents coming in.

- que:
  - looks great, doesnt it?
  ans:
  - sorry you cant be with us.

- que:
  - but something was definitely chewing on her... after she was dumped here.
  ans:
  - you know we were on television last week?

- que:
  - sam, what do we got here?
  ans:
  - i'd say we got ourselves a homicide.

- que:
  - see that blood?
  ans:
  - it was smeared on.

- que:
  - you don't think it was one of those voodoo things, do you?
  ans:
  - no, the chicken blood's there to attract pigs.

- que:
  - you know what killed her?
  ans:
  - probably blunt force trauma, judging by the cranial bruising.

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - they pulled what was left of a body out of the swamp down there.

- que:
  - listen, chief, how about i stay here?
  ans:
  - send abrams down, grab a few photos...

- que:
  - not a pretty sight, is it?
  ans:
  - looks like he's been in the water for 48 hours, give or take.

- que:
  - you know anything about this guy?
  ans:
  - not a lot.

- que:
  - did you put a verdict down on the cause of death yet?
  ans:
  - alligator attack.

- que:
  - then why call in an me?
  ans:
  - because these don't look like any gator bites i've ever seen before.

- que:
  - where'd they find the body?
  ans:
  - way out in the deep swamp.

- que:
  - you got a phone around here?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - you sam rivers?
  ans:
  - that would be me.

- que:
  - you the biologist?
  ans:
  - mary callahan.

- que:
  - so, you ready?
  ans:
  - yeah, let's do it.

- que:
  - water?
  ans:
  - no, i've got some cold ones in the cooler, if you want.

- que:
  - you get a lot of swamp murders?
  ans:
  - no, not really.

- que:
  - you want to take a look at some photos of the body... and tell me what you think?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - is that your professional opinion?
  ans:
  - it's extremely unlikely that an alligator could have done this.

- que:
  - but we're a little too far upriver for a great white, aren't we?
  ans:
  - yeah, but not for a bull shark.

- que:
  - you think a boat propeller could have done that?
  ans:
  - no boat this big could have traveled that far up the bayou.

- que:
  - well, what do you think happened then?
  ans:
  - probably some redneck poacher's idea of a joke.

- que:
  - is he okay?
  ans:
  - watch.

- que:
  - is it biting you?
  ans:
  - hell, yeah.

- que:
  - some strange fella stick his hand in your hole, wouldn't you bite him?
  ans:
  - this is like the dark side of hee haw.

- que:
  - what y'all want with old john?
  ans:
  - john's dead.

- que:
  - y'all cops?
  ans:
  - my name's sam rivers.

- que:
  - fisting a catfish?
  ans:
  - well, i don't know what happened to john.

- que:
  - god, who would want to live so far away from everything?
  ans:
  - hey, pardner, pull up over there.

- que:
  - whose houseboat is that?
  ans:
  - that's my niece and her naked husband.

- que:
  - and who lives in those?
  ans:
  - that house over there on the left, that's ricardo's.

- que:
  - either of you have any ideas of what happened to mr. crankton?
  ans:
  - we feel real sad about what happened to john.

- que:
  - now, ricardo, he's the one that found the body, right?
  ans:
  - he doesn't talk much.

- que:
  - how about gloria?
  ans:
  - well, come on, we'll see.

- que:
  - i hate to bother you, but is your mama in the house?
  ans:
  - yeah, she's in there.

- que:
  - you want to come in?
  ans:
  - eliza, your mother will not let me pack up the shrine.

- que:
  - dan, if she doesn't want to move the altar, can we just leave it there?
  ans:
  - that's fine, i just...

- que:
  - just the two of you?
  ans:
  - damn fool.

- que:
  - this boat, can you show it to us?
  ans:
  - no, i can't go there.

- que:
  - what is this thing?
  ans:
  - it's just some crazy old voodoo stuff.

- que:
  - y'all want some fruit?
  ans:
  - no, thanks.

- que:
  - guess not, huh?
  ans:
  - got no shame, them two.

- que:
  - what's a boat that size doing way up in the swamp?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - you've been on it before?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how long has this thing been here?
  ans:
  - about three months.

- que:
  - not even to look for something worth taking?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did john crankton go aboard?
  ans:
  - never said he did.

- que:
  - what is that smell?
  ans:
  - something's rotten.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - my god, look at this.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - it's a fish scale.

- que:
  - elmer, you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - it's about 50 miles downriver.

- que:
  - so, what happened?
  ans:
  - we have no idea.

- que:
  - well, what about the cargo?
  ans:
  - don't know.

- que:
  - none of your great white hunter bullshit, okay?
  ans:
  - let me get someone in there to check it out and take care of things.

- que:
  - you got that?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so, you're saying there's a swamp monster out here killing people?
  ans:
  - look, the only thing that's out there are things that belong there.

- que:
  - look, are we safe here?
  ans:
  - that boat is about three miles away from here.

- que:
  - bother us?
  ans:
  - it killed my dad.

- que:
  - and what's with all the equipment?
  ans:
  - anton, meet ben.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - we've already been on a couple of hunts together.

- que:
  - what are we dealing with?
  ans:
  - well, it's clearly carnivorous... which right there, narrows it down to about four or five fish on the planet.

- que:
  - how the hell did it get so big?
  ans:
  - it's the bayou.

- que:
  - isn't he afraid of whatever is out there?
  ans:
  - ricardo ain't scared of anything.

- que:
  - sam?
  ans:
  - no thanks.

- que:
  - snapping turtle?
  ans:
  - why, yes.

- que:
  - where did you say you were from again?
  ans:

  ans:
  - that's just lovely.

- que:
  - would you guys excuse us for a minute, please?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - look, i'm sorry, okay?
  ans:
  - dan, i didn't ask for your help.

- que:
  - why do you put up with him?
  ans:
  - because i'm a paralegal in his office.

- que:
  - who says i'm talking about a guy?

  - so is this all right to welcome the viscount and his nephew?
  ans:
  - very appropriate.

- que:
  - yeah, what about joe's suggestion, huh?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i just so don't want to be nice to this guy, you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, he is rude, he's arrogant, self centered, he's...

- que:
  - ah, well, have you met him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is that about?
  ans:
  - oh, tush.

- que:
  - mia, would you care to welcome our guest?
  ans:
  - lord nicholas.

- que:
  - would you care to explain what was going on out there?
  ans:
  - sorry.

  ans:
  - mm.

- que:
  - someone like him?
  ans:
  - yes.

  ans:
  - is that...

- que:
  - why don't you open it?
  ans:
  - you'll see.

- que:
  - do i have to put it on myself?
  ans:
  - no, i could do that.

- que:
  - you ready?
  ans:
  - if you are.

- que:
  - and you're sure my father wanted this?
  ans:
  - it was his dearest wish.

- que:
  - but you do remember who he named you after, don't you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why are we whispering?
  ans:
  - i'm hiding from my lady's maids.

- que:
  - are you having second thoughts?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, is there something you wanted to say to me?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - big feet?
  ans:
  - brigitte, i found her.

- que:
  - the ballroom?
  ans:
  - i don't think she's in the ballroom.

- que:
  - the ballroom?
  ans:
  - yeah, that is exactly what you did.

- que:
  - what is a lie dance?
  ans:
  - i'll go look in the ballroom myself.

- que:
  - what is the point?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - and what am i trying to do?
  ans:
  - i think we both know exactly what that is.

- que:
  - she was in a closet?
  ans:
  - with him.

- que:
  - does she have the makings of a queen?
  ans:
  - well, she's young, but i've always believed in her.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm ok.

- que:
  - what are we learning today?
  ans:
  - we are learning the art of the fan.

- que:
  - are you sassing your grandma?
  ans:
  - i would never sass you, grandma.

- que:
  - may i?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - a princess never chases a chicken.

- que:
  - did you come up with this on your own?
  ans:
  - oh, no, it's a centuries old idea.

- que:
  - our ancestors knew a thing or two, right?
  ans:
  - you just drape your skirt over it and nobody suspects a thing.

- que:
  - so let's get it really spooked, shall we?
  ans:
  - this is a fake snake.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - just think, mia.

- que:
  - so just this once, can you please let me be miserable, and not make me feel worse about myself?
  ans:
  - just go away.

- que:
  - am i going to be disappointed in you?
  ans:
  - unfortunate incident, that.

- que:
  - you going to come and see me off?
  ans:
  - i'd like to speak with your uncle alone, nicholas.

- que:
  - why are you so against princess mia being queen?
  ans:
  - well, my uncle feels that princess mia doesn't know the people.

- que:
  - and you feel you do know the people?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you do?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how can one rule the people if they do not know the people?
  ans:
  - touch.

- que:
  - how are your grandchildren, lily, charlotte and sam?
  ans:
  - they're wonderful.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - good to see you.

- que:
  - maury, right?
  ans:
  - he is great.

- que:
  - you remember him from last summer?
  ans:
  - mia's doing well.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - the king wannabe with lady elissa.

- que:
  - is she his... girlfriend?
  ans:
  - nicholas doesn't have girlfriends, he has dates.

- que:
  - you talk to him much?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - andrew?
  ans:
  - yes, dear.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - just one more, please.

- que:
  - why not brag?
  ans:
  - you're an amazing woman.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - that's wonderful.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - andrew spent four months in papua new guinea studying the bark of a yam tree.

- que:
  - andrew, would you like to get a drink?
  ans:
  - i would absolutely love to.

- que:
  - oh, really?
  ans:
  - yes...

- que:
  - understands you?
  ans:
  - wow.

- que:
  - why would i be jealous of andrew?
  ans:
  - he's got to spend the rest of his life married to you.

- que:
  - what is wrong with you?
  ans:
  - you can't just go around kissing people.

- que:
  - you want to kiss again?
  ans:
  - well, i...

- que:
  - what's confusing about a kiss?
  ans:
  - you're just trying to make me like you so that i won't want to marry andrew and so that you can have the crown.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i have an idea.

- que:
  - why don't you go underwater and i'll count to a million?
  ans:
  - mia, careful...

- que:
  - do i want to know?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - she's going to be a handful, isn't she?
  ans:
  - you'll never be bored, andrew.

- que:
  - do you think i plan for this kind of stuff to happen?
  ans:
  - i lost it.

- que:
  - can you try to grasp that concept?
  ans:
  - the concept is grasped.

- que:
  - or are you upset with me too?
  ans:
  - royal guard of genovia, fall in.

- que:
  - why do you talk like that?
  ans:
  - i'm captain kip kelly of the royal guard.

- que:
  - what if we all talked like that?
  ans:
  - that was very nicely done, miss lilly.

- que:
  - flag?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - flag?
  ans:
  - welcome.

- que:
  - may i offer you a flag?
  ans:
  - thank you, i am not a waving aficionado.

- que:
  - how do you feel today, my dear?
  ans:
  - honestly, joe, not that great.

- que:
  - well, would you feel better if you called me joey?
  ans:
  - no, joe.

- que:
  - mia?
  ans:
  - she's stopped the parade.

- que:
  - what's the princess going to do now?
  ans:
  - she's walking towards the children's shelter.

- que:
  - would you like to be a princess today?
  ans:
  - i can't, i'm too little.

- que:
  - give them all free tiaras?
  ans:
  - i'll take care of it later.

- que:
  - can we be in the parade?
  ans:
  - of course, of course.

- que:
  - so are you ready?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - everybody having fun?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - lord crawley, how is your brother doing?
  ans:
  - i don't speak to my brother.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - we're setting up the ramp in the ballroom.

- que:
  - are you crashing my bridal shower?
  ans:
  - sadly, no.

- que:
  - lilly?
  ans:
  - the princesses are arriving.

- que:
  - is this my party?
  ans:
  - no, this is princess mia's party.

- que:
  - felix?
  ans:
  - i thought you never slide.

- que:
  - the song you sang at my 1 8th birthday party.
  ans:
  - is she really going to do this?

- que:
  - remember that?
  ans:
  - go on.

- que:
  - what are you saying?
  ans:
  - well, she's smart.

- que:
  - are you mad?
  ans:
  - she believes in genovia so much that she's convinced herself to marry someone that she knows she can never love.

- que:
  - after all the effort that we have put in, to end up with nothing?
  ans:
  - it wouldn't be nothing.

- que:
  - that she will leave andrew and marry you?
  ans:
  - i put in the effort to make you a king, not to have you marry a queen.

- que:
  - are you sure i didn't burn you?
  ans:
  - of course you did.

- que:
  - can i talk to you for a second?
  ans:
  - uh huh.

- que:
  - should i shoo him?
  ans:
  - just tell me who i should shoo and i'll shoo.

- que:
  - why don't you go introduce lilly to your parents?
  ans:
  - you know, just tell them i'll be up for brunch in a second.

- que:
  - would you please try to keep up, brigitta?
  ans:
  - he's trying to steal the crown.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - mm hm.

- que:
  - excuse me?
  ans:
  - touch your mouth.

- que:
  - how did that feel?
  ans:
  - wonderful.

- que:
  - you're leaving?
  ans:
  - i think it's time i bowed out gracefully.

- que:
  - don't you?
  ans:
  - goodbye.

- que:
  - could i see you one more time before i go?
  ans:
  - nicholas, i'm watched like a hawk.

  ans:
  - are you tired?

- que:
  - the forest's poison?
  ans:
  - it's master yupa.

- que:
  - reminds me of nausicaa when she was young.
  ans:
  - okay, toeto?

- que:
  - would you please be this child's godfather?
  ans:
  - so that a good wind will always blow for her.

- que:
  - saved by this child?
  ans:
  - this valley is good.

- que:
  - how were your travels this time?
  ans:
  - it's terrible.

- que:
  - why can't they live like you in this valley?
  ans:
  - it's because here we are protected by the blessed wind that blows from the sea.

- que:
  - why don't you settle in this valley soon?
  ans:
  - i'm in this condition.

- que:
  - destined, you say?
  ans:
  - my, my...

- que:
  - you didn't know, nausicaa?
  ans:
  - there it's in that tapestry on the wall.

- que:
  - same thing, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i only want to solve the riddle of the wastelands.

- que:
  - are we, the human race, destined to be swallowed by the wastelands and be destroyed?
  ans:
  - goll says he smells something in the wind.

- que:
  - it's almost dawn, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i'll be right there.

- que:
  - it's a plane.
  ans:
  - why would a plane be in a borderland like this?

- que:
  - how could they?
  ans:
  - they must have been in the wasteland and killed some insects.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - the valley of the wind.

- que:
  - the cargo?
  ans:
  - wait.

- que:
  - if even one remains, it would be a disaster.
  ans:
  - ohmu?

- que:
  - what is this thing?
  ans:
  - it didn't burn, even in the fire.

- que:
  - master yupa, what is this?
  ans:
  - in my travels, i heard of an ominous rumor.

- que:
  - a monster from the ancient world?
  ans:
  - all the god warriors should have become fossils by now.

- que:
  - what can it be?
  ans:
  - it's a torumekian ship.

- que:
  - though it may have been a small thing, is this the courtesy of torumekia towards such a country?
  ans:
  - if you're starting a war, you should give a reason.

- que:
  - aren't you yupa miralda, the best swordsman in the borderlands?
  ans:
  - we have revived the miraculous skills and powers that once made the human race...... the masters of this planet.

- que:
  - it's a pretty nice valley, don't you think?
  ans:
  - i'm opposed to this.

- que:
  - are you saying we should make that monster the play thing of those fools back home?
  ans:
  - yes, spoils of war.

- que:
  - five hostages, the gunship, and goods, you say?
  ans:
  - i'll leave the selection of the hostages up to you.

- que:
  - teto, where is your mistress?
  ans:
  - nausicaa.

- que:
  - what is the meaning of this?
  ans:
  - these are plants from the wasteland.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - even this venomous hisokusari plant has flowered.

- que:
  - you found that out all by yourself?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have i ever lied to you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have i?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - my butt is killing me.

- que:
  - why are they in such a tight formation?
  ans:
  - the engine noise is a hindrance.

- que:
  - did you think i would get on my knees and thank you?
  ans:
  - the ohmu's eyes are bright red.

- que:
  - princess what do you think you're doing with mehve?
  ans:
  - when the water calms down, take off at once and wait up in the air.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - no, go home, boy.

- que:
  - now, who's with me?
  ans:
  - i am, wallace.

- que:
  - where do you think you're going?
  ans:

  - da?
  ans:
  - william.

- que:
  - you didn't want your father to die either, did you?
  ans:
  - but it happened.

- que:
  - did the priest give a poetic benediction?
  ans:
  - it was in latin.

- que:
  - well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the lord bless thee and keep thee.

- que:
  - what are they doing?
  ans:
  - saying good bye in their own way playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

- que:
  - where is my son?
  ans:
  - your pardon, milord.

- que:
  - shall i leave, milord?
  ans:
  - if he wants his queen to rule when i am gone, then, by all means, stay and learn how.

- que:
  - are they?
  ans:
  - the trouble with scotland is that it's full ofscots.

- que:
  - that should fetch just the kind of lords we want to scotland, taxes or no taxes, huh?
  ans:
  - a most excellent idea, sire.

- que:
  - is it?
  ans:
  - now in edinburgh ga thered the council of scottish nobles.

- que:
  - and how is your father?
  ans:
  - mm hmm.

  ans:
  - come do it.

  ans:
  - it was the best way to make you leave.

- que:
  - can you not?
  ans:
  - no.

  - you mean lreland?
  ans:
  - i didn't like him anyway.

- que:
  - do the nobles rally?
  ans:
  - robert the bruce and most ofthe others will not commit to battle, but word has spread, and the highlanders are coming down on their own.

  ans:
  - albagu bra!

- que:
  - the king's terms?
  ans:
  - he'll never live up to them.

  - shall we go and meet them?

  ans:
  - just be yourselves.

- que:

- que:
  - from his king?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - does anyone know his politics?
  ans:
  - no, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.

- que:
  - wait sir william, where are you going?
  ans:
  - we have beaten the english, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.

- que:
  - what will you do?
  ans:

  - why is that impossible?
  ans:
  - there's a difference between us.

- que:
  - the common man that bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less?

  - no... but from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

- que:
  - will you speak with a woman?
  ans:
  - i understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

- que:
  - the executioner ofthe king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
  ans:

- que:
  - longshanks desires peace?
  ans:
  - he declares it to me.

- que:
  - a lordship and titles... gold... that i should become judas?
  ans:
  - peace is made in such ways.

- que:
  - so he accepted our bribe?
  ans:
  - no, he did not.

- que:
  - then why does he stay?
  ans:
  - my scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:
  - the welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.

- que:
  - lrish conscripts?
  ans:
  - even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.

- que:
  - tell me... what kind of man is he?
  ans:
  - a mindless barbarian.

- que:
  - why are the lrish fighting with the english?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't worry about them.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you before?
  ans:
  - it's my island.

- que:
  - you said yourself the nobles will not support wallace.
  ans:
  - other options?

- que:
  - so how did it help us tojoin the side that is slaughtered?
  ans:
  - i gave him my word.

- que:
  - wouldn't you agree?
  ans:
  - the archers are ready, sire.

- que:
  - lochlan?
  ans:
  - i gave mornay double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england.

- que:
  - won't we hit our own troops?
  ans:
  - yes... but we'll hit theirs as well.

- que:
  - shall we retire?
  ans:
  - protect the king.

- que:
  - nothing?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there will be a new shipment ofsupplies coming north next month foods and weapons.

- que:
  - why do you help me?
  ans:

- que:
  - well, what's the point?
  ans:
  - you've all sworn loyalty to longshanks.

  - one?
  ans:
  - you mean us and you.

- que:
  - it's a trap.
  ans:
  - what about the others?

- que:
  - are you blind?
  ans:
  - look at us.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - aye, i do.

- que:
  - a dream?
  ans:
  - just a...

- que:
  - well, then what have we been doing all this time?
  ans:
  - we've lived that dream.

- que:
  - shall i come with you?
  ans:
  - longshanks acquired wallace.

- que:
  - against whom?
  ans:
  - against your king.

- que:
  - have you anything to say?
  ans:
  - never in my whole life... did i swear allegiance to him.

- que:
  - do you confess?
  ans:
  - then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.

- que:
  - who do you think will rule this kingdom?
  ans:
  - now open this door.

- que:
  - will he show mercy to my country?
  ans:
  - mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower.

- que:
  - in time, who knows what can happen... if you can only live?
  ans:
  - if i swear to him, then all that i am is dead already.

- que:
  - you're quite taken with him, aren't you?
  ans:
  - rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more.

- que:
  - enough?
  ans:
  - ohh.

- que:
  - does anyone know his politics?
  ans:
  - no, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.

- que:
  - wait sir william, where are you going?
  ans:
  - we have beaten the english, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.

- que:
  - what will you do?
  ans:
  - i will invade england and defeat the english on their own ground.

- que:
  - ha ha ha invade?
  ans:
  - that's impossible.

- que:
  - why is that impossible?
  ans:
  - there's a difference between us.

- que:
  - the common man that bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less?
  ans:
  - no... but from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

- que:
  - we need them?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - tell me, what does that mean to be noble?
  ans:
  - to here, my lord.

- que:
  - what news of the north?
  ans:
  - nothing new, your majesty.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - wallace has sacked york.

- que:
  - what beast could do such a thing?
  ans:
  - i have declared phillip my high counselor.

- que:
  - is he qualified?
  ans:
  - i am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.

- que:
  - then tell me... what advice would you offer on the, uh, present, uh, situation?
  ans:
  - i shall offer a truce... and buy him off.

- que:
  - but who will go to him?
  ans:
  - not i.

- que:
  - whom do i send?
  ans:
  - i'm dreaming.

- que:
  - to do what?
  ans:
  - to discuss the king's proposals.

- que:
  - will you speak with a woman?
  ans:
  - i understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

- que:
  - the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
  ans:
  - well, longshanks did far worse the last time he took a scottish city.

- que:
  - longshanks desires peace?
  ans:
  - he declares it to me.

- que:
  - a lordship and titles... gold... that i should become judas?
  ans:
  - peace is made in such ways.

- que:
  - so he accepted our bribe?
  ans:
  - no, he did not.

- que:
  - then why does he stay?
  ans:
  - my scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:
  - the welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.

- que:
  - irish conscripts?
  ans:
  - even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.

- que:
  - tell me... what kind of man is he?
  ans:
  - a mindless barbarian.

- que:
  - why are the irish fighting with the english?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't worry about them.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you before?
  ans:
  - it's my island.

- que:
  - you said yourself the nobles will not support wallace.
  ans:
  - other options?

- que:
  - so how did it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?
  ans:
  - i gave him my word.

- que:
  - wouldn't you agree?
  ans:
  - the archers are ready, sire.

- que:
  - lochlan?
  ans:
  - i gave mornay double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england.

- que:
  - won't we hit our own troops?
  ans:
  - yes... but we'll hit theirs as well.

- que:
  - shall we retire?
  ans:
  - protect the king.

- que:
  - nothing?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month foods and weapons.

- que:
  - why do you help me?
  ans:
  - because of the way you are looking at me now.

- que:
  - well, what's the point?
  ans:
  - you've all sworn loyalty to longshanks.

- que:
  - one?
  ans:
  - you mean us and you.

- que:
  - it's a trap.
  ans:
  - what about the others?

- que:
  - are you blind?
  ans:
  - look at us.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - aye, i do.

- que:
  - a dream?
  ans:
  - just a...

- que:
  - well, then what have we been doing all this time?
  ans:
  - we've lived that dream.

- que:

- que:
  - you're quite taken with him, aren't you?
  ans:
  - hds, sir.

- que:
  - how are you this afternoon?
  ans:
  - alrighty.

- que:
  - do you mind if i pet him?
  ans:
  - i don't give a rat's ass.

  ans:
  - what's the matter with you?

- que:
  - hungry, fellow?
  ans:
  - there you go.

- que:

- que:

  ans:
  - he's in third grade.

- que:
  - third grade?
  ans:
  - but you're so little.

- que:
  - anika?
  ans:
  - mom...

- que:
  - well what good is that kind of love?
  ans:
  - i'm thinking of leaving.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - where would you like to go?
  ans:
  - i can't afford to go anywhere.

- que:
  - why new orleans?
  ans:
  - bourbon st.

- que:
  - what's your second choice?
  ans:
  - vegas.

- que:
  - what about ben's dad?
  ans:
  - he's a deadbeat.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - it's an inspector nestor book.

- que:
  - remember when you used to read these to me?
  ans:
  - you'd always know how each story was going to end half way through every book.

- que:
  - they miss you, you know?
  ans:
  - the whole team misses you.

- que:
  - anything you want me to tell the team at last practice?
  ans:
  - tell them to make a fucking basket.

- que:
  - but that's what you said.
  ans:
  - what gives?

- que:
  - why didn't you call if you knew you were going to be late?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i didn't know it was that big a deal.

- que:
  - what's your problem, anika?
  ans:
  - nothing, jim.

- que:

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so i guess the question we need to ask ourselves is, are we going to let those 14 games determine the next one?
  ans:
  - because if we are, then we may as welljust go out there and shake hands with the other team.

- que:
  - so why do we play at all?
  ans:
  - well team...

- que:
  - and do you know why?
  ans:

- que:
  - what did your master steal for the conte?
  ans:
  - we may be young, but we're not completely stupid.

- que:
  - well, you don't think the conte could keep the merry go round secret in the city, do you?

  - well, what on earth is that?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - 15?
  ans:
  - with this money, i can be any age i want.

  - who is it?
  ans:
  - your godmother.

- que:
  - are you expecting visitors?
  ans:
  - no one dares to set foot on this island.

- que:
  - does he know about that merry go round?
  ans:
  - good heavens, no.

- que:
  - but what if he rode the merry go round and is now all old like you?
  ans:
  - i don't know what funny stories you've been listening to.

- que:
  - does it matter which one we ride?
  ans:
  - the lion was the right mount for me, but to grow older... you two must choose one of the water creatures.

- que:
  - the sea horse or the merman?
  ans:
  - what you do is your choice, but i can't do this.

- que:
  - what about bo?

  ans:
  - majesty...

- que:
  - you, kaya maghan... speak to a madman?
  ans:
  - i'd rather speak to a madman than to a bunch of puppet advisors, who are inapt and opinionless.

  - i went looking for the troll.

- que:
  - blood?
  ans:
  - last night, i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion...... so he could get past that dog.

  ans:
  - at gringotts, hagrid took something out of the vault.

- que:

- que:
  - how could i be so stupid?
  ans:
  - i checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

- que:
  - nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher's stone.
  ans:
  - this is light?

  ans:
  - the philosopher's stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers.

- que:
  - immortal?
  ans:
  - it means you'll never die.

- que:
  - are you still on about him?
  ans:
  - we know he's after it.

  ans:
  - malfoy.

  - is that bad?
  ans:
  - it's bad.

- que:
  - good god, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
  ans:
  - norbert's gone.

- que:
  - that's good, isn't it?
  ans:
  - he's with his own kind.

- que:
  - what if the other dragons are mean to him?
  ans:
  - he's only a baby.

- que:
  - the forest?
  ans:
  - i thought that was a joke.

- que:
  - hagrid, what is that?
  ans:
  - what we're here for.

- que:
  - see that?
  ans:
  - that's unicorn blood, that is.

- que:
  - do you hear that?
  ans:
  - harry potter, you must leave.

- que:
  - what was that thing you saved me from?
  ans:
  - a monstrous creature.

- que:
  - do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
  ans:
  - the philosopher's stone.

  - you all right there, harry?
  ans:
  - harry potter, this is where i leave you.

- que:
  - you mean, you know who is out there right now in the forest?
  ans:
  - but he's weak.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - we had it wrong.

- que:
  - but if he comes back...... you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
  ans:
  - if he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight.

- que:
  - who's the one wizard voldemort always feared?
  ans:
  - dumbledore.

- que:
  - all right there, harry?
  ans:
  - i never saw his face.

- que:
  - was he interested in fluffy?
  ans:
  - of course he was interested.

- que:
  - how often do you come across a three headed dog?
  ans:
  - take fluffy, for example.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - we have to see dumbledore.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - someone's going to try and steal it.

- que:
  - now would you go back to your dormitories?
  ans:
  - quietly.

- que:
  - what would three young gryffindors...... be doing inside on a day like this?
  ans:
  - we were just you ought to be careful.

- que:
  - now what do we do?
  ans:
  - we go down the trap door.

- que:
  - you're sneaking out again, aren't you?
  ans:
  - neville, listen.

- que:
  - you're a little scary sometimes, you know that?
  ans:
  - brilliant, but scary.

- que:
  - if something bad happens, get yourselves out.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - does it seem a bit quiet to you?
  ans:
  - the harp.

- que:
  - trust me.
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what's this all about?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what will we do?
  ans:
  - there must be a thousand keys.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - it's too simple.

- que:
  - where are we?
  ans:
  - a graveyard.

- que:
  - it's obvious, isn't it?
  ans:
  - we've got to play our way across the room.

- que:
  - what happens now?
  ans:
  - well, white moves first.

- que:
  - ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...... real wizard's chess, do you?
  ans:
  - harry, it's you that has to go on.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - books and cleverness.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - but that day, during the quidditch match, snape tried to kill me.

- que:
  - snape was trying to save me?
  ans:
  - i knew you were a danger to me, especially after halloween.

- que:
  - now, what does this mirror do?
  ans:
  - i see what i desire.

- que:
  - but how do i get it?
  ans:
  - let me speak to him.

- que:
  - see what i must do to survive?
  ans:
  - live off another.

- que:
  - your parents had it too.
  ans:
  - why suffer an horrific death...... when you can join me and live?

- que:
  - tell me, harry...... would you like to see your mother and father again?
  ans:
  - together...... we can bring them back.

- que:
  - admirers?
  ans:
  - what happened in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a secret.

- que:
  - what about hermione?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - what happened to the stone?
  ans:
  - relax, dear boy.

- que:
  - but then, flamel, he'll die, won't he?
  ans:
  - he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order.

- que:
  - and between you and me, that is saying something.
  ans:
  - how is it i got the stone, sir?

- que:
  - does that mean, with the stone gone, that voldemort can never come back?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid...... there are ways in which he can return.

- que:
  - harry, do you know why...... professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
  ans:
  - it was because of your mother.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - love, harry.

- que:
  - all right there, ron?
  ans:
  - all right.

  - hermione?
  ans:
  - never better.

- que:
  - thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you?
  ans:
  - this is for you.

- que:
  - feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - i'm not going home.

- que:
  - is it dead?
  ans:
  - i don't think so, just knocked out.

- que:
  - mrs. granger?
  ans:
  - i thought i can handle it.

- que:
  - what's it?
  ans:
  - some kinda coat.

- que:
  - you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell.
  ans:
  - why did he give it to you?

- que:
  - you up to that?
  ans:
  - my doctor recommended it.

- que:
  - that means you don't want me to?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you know that there are over 8000 websites that mention you?
  ans:
  - that's not possible.

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - i know you grew up in l. a., which i thought nobody did.

- que:
  - the truth is, it goes by fast, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - like the blink of an eye.

- que:
  - but why do you only pick up the white ones?
  ans:
  - i don't pick up only the white ones.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - so you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.

- que:
  - can i ask you something, harry?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - just like to travel light.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, but what does that mean?
  ans:
  - now, see, a 30 year old gets that.

- que:
  - have you noticed?
  ans:
  - i'm serious.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, but...

- que:
  - you interested?
  ans:
  - ringside seat.

- que:
  - big dinner date?
  ans:
  - yeah, as a matter of fact, with your doctor.

- que:
  - but we're just having dinner, it's not a date.
  ans:
  - he's not too young for you?

- que:
  - does he know that?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna tell him.

- que:
  - julian, can i ask you something?
  ans:
  - anything.

- que:
  - julian, can i ask you something?
  ans:
  - anything.

- que:
  - how old are you?
  ans:
  - i'm 36.

- que:
  - that's a lot of years to be older than somebody, don't you think?
  ans:
  - i don't think it matters at all.

- que:
  - you don't?
  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - honestly?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so, what do you want to be?
  ans:
  - i'd embarrass you if i told you.

- que:
  - don't you like girls your own age?
  ans:
  - i do, but i've never met one i've reacted to...... quite like this.

- que:
  - and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before...... don't you have to find out what it is?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you're kidding, right?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you ever think of that?
  ans:
  - it was interesting.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - writing.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - so was your date a date?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think so.

- que:
  - with your social life?
  ans:
  - my dear, you're confusing sex with sleeping.

- que:
  - what are my choices?
  ans:
  - i mean, i know you think i'm not very discriminating when it comes to...

- que:
  - what difference does it make what i think of you?
  ans:
  - i can't even imagine what you think of me.

- que:
  - grilled cheese?
  ans:
  - pancakes.

- que:
  - you ever miss being married?
  ans:
  - bet you were great at it.

- que:
  - was one of us just saying something interesting?
  ans:
  - you said you can't imagine what i think of you.

- que:
  - will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night?
  ans:
  - the phone doesn't ring that much at night...... and the whole alone thing happens at night.

- que:
  - i'm sorry, okay?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, but...

- que:
  - you know what you're like?
  ans:
  - you're like one of those great portraits you see over a fireplace.

- que:
  - such as?
  ans:
  - flinty.

- que:
  - so you think i'm inhuman?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - cold, distant, like i'm frozen in some painting?
  ans:
  - not at all.

- que:
  - you know, i can't decide if, god, do you hate me?
  ans:
  - or if you're the only person who ever really got me.

- que:
  - you don't?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - room service.
  ans:
  - mom?

- que:
  - what are you doing here at this hour?
  ans:
  - i had this big benefit.

- que:
  - this one doesn't sleep either.
  ans:
  - you guys are making pancakes?

- que:

  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - when can you go home?
  ans:
  - i really am gonna do a little work, so why don't you just finish this...... and you two catch up.

- que:
  - you don't want pancakes anymore?
  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i met someone else.

  ans:
  - he just took care of it for me.

  - well, are you sure it's plan r?
  ans:
  - huh.

- que:
  - we don't want to start a nuclear war unless we have to, do we?
  ans:
  - please sit down.

- que:
  - what about the planes?
  ans:
  - surely we must issue the recall code immediately.

- que:
  - are you certain?
  ans:
  - i'm absolutely positive.

- que:
  - what if it is true?
  ans:
  - ... i would say, sir, that there was something dreadfully wrong somewhere.

- que:
  - why don't you take it easy, group captain?
  ans:
  - please make me a drink of grain alcohol and rainwater...... and help yourself to whatever you'd like.

- que:
  - have you got them handy?
  ans:
  - when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing...... there will be only one course of action open.

- que:
  - mandrake, do you recall what clemenceau once said about war?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think i do, sir.

- que:
  - staines, is everybody here?
  ans:
  - mr. president, the secretary of state is in vietnam.

- que:
  - general turgidson, what's going on?
  ans:
  - it appears that the order called for the planes...... to attack their targets inside russia.

- que:
  - plan r?
  ans:
  - you approved it, sir.

- que:
  - a safeguard?
  ans:
  - i admit the human element seems to have failed us here.

- que:
  - then why haven't you radioed the planes, countermanding the go code?
  ans:
  - we're unable to communicate with any of the aircraft.

- que:
  - you mean to tell me you will be unable to recall the aircraft?
  ans:
  - that's the size of it.

- que:
  - how soon will the planes penetrate russian radar cover?
  ans:
  - about 18 minutes from now.

- que:
  - are you in contact with general ripper?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

  - i'll just check, sir.

- que:
  - hello?
  ans:
  - i told you never to call me here.

- que:
  - don't you know where i am?
  ans:
  - look, baby, i can't talk to you now.

- que:
  - mr. president, there are one or two points i'd like to make, if i may?
  ans:
  - go ahead, general.

- que:
  - any difficulty?
  ans:
  - he's having a fit about the m. p. s.

- que:
  - is that the russian ambassador?
  ans:
  - yes, it is, general.

- que:
  - am i to understand the russian ambassador...... is to be admitted entrance to the war room?
  ans:
  - that is correct.

- que:
  - i don't know exactly how to put this, sir...... but are you aware of what a breach of security that would be?
  ans:
  - he'll see everything.

- que:
  - you don't have any fresh fish?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not, sir.

- que:
  - your eggs are fresh?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - that will be all, sir?
  ans:

  - i see.

- que:
  - so we're both sorry, all right?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the fools.

- que:
  - what's happened?
  ans:
  - the doomsday machine.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - a device which will destroy all human and animal life on earth.

- que:
  - have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water?
  ans:
  - well, i can't say i have, jack.

- que:
  - that's what they drink, isn't it?
  ans:
  - never water.

- que:
  - why, do you realize that...... 70  of you is water?
  ans:
  - good lord.

- que:
  - you beginning to understand?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have you never wondered why i drink only distilled water...... or rainwater, and only pure grain alcohol?
  ans:
  - it did occur to me, jack, yes.

- que:
  - have you ever heard of fluoridation of water?
  ans:
  - yes, i have heard of that, jack, yes.

- que:
  - do you know what it is?
  ans:
  - no, no, i don't know what it is.

- que:
  - do you realize that fluoridation...... is the most monstrously conceived...... and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face?
  ans:
  - two can play at that game, soldier.

- que:
  - you calling me, jack?
  ans:
  - come over here and help me with this belt.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - the string.

- que:
  - what about it?
  ans:
  - cobalt thorium g has a radioactive half life of 93 years.

- que:
  - is the premier threatening to explode it if our planes carry out their attack?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - this is absolute madness.
  ans:
  - automatically?

- que:
  - why should you build such a thing?
  ans:
  - there are those of us who fought against it.

- que:
  - dr. strangelove, do we have anything like that in the works?
  ans:
  - a moment, please, mr. president.

- que:
  - you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing?
  ans:
  - mr. president, the technology required is easily within the means...... of even the smallest nuclear power.

- que:
  - but how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically...... and at the same time impossible to un trigger?
  ans:
  - mr. president, it is not only possible...... it is essential.

- que:
  - how can it be triggered automatically?
  ans:
  - it's remarkably simple to do that.

- que:
  - that ain't no kraut name, is it?
  ans:
  - he changed it when he became a citizen.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell the world?
  ans:
  - it was to be announced at the party congress on monday.

- que:
  - don't you think we'd be better off away from this flying glass?
  ans:
  - we're okay here.

- que:
  - you know when fluoridation first began?
  ans:
  - no, i don't, jack.

- que:
  - it's incredibly obvious, isn't it?
  ans:
  - a foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids...... without the knowledge of the individual.

- que:
  - supposing a bit of water has gone off, eh?
  ans:
  - certainly one can never be too sure about those things.

- que:
  - do i look all rancid and clotted?
  ans:
  - look at me, jack.

- que:
  - were you ever a prisoner of war?
  ans:
  - yes, i was, as a matter of fact.

- que:

  ans:
  - yes, they did.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i don't know, jack.

- que:
  - no, jack, let me take that for you.
  ans:

  - all i ask from you is a very simple answer to a very simple question.

- que:
  - now, how do your clients plead?
  ans:
  - i think i get the point.

- que:
  - will you go for two counts of contempt?
  ans:
  - not guilty.

- que:
  - you know that, right?
  ans:
  - let's go.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - well, it's a lot of procedure, that's all.

- que:
  - learn as you go?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - didn't they teach that in law school?
  ans:
  - no, they didn't.

- que:
  - because, between your father's garage and working nights, when was i supposed to go?
  ans:
  - i thought this summer i would take off a couple of months.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm sure.

- que:
  - how can you be so sure when you don't know what it is you're supposed to know?
  ans:
  - it's a procedure.

- que:
  - you know how the first thing you do is you take the carburettor off the manifold?
  ans:
  - suppose you skip the first step, and as you're replacing one of the jets, you drop the jet.

- que:
  - well, is there any way i could help out in this procedure situation?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you say you got stiffed?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:
  - a counteroffer?
  ans:
  - let me see.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i could use a good ass kicking, i'll be very honest with you.

- que:
  - you like to renegotiate as you go along, huh?
  ans:
  - ok, then.

- que:
  - do i have to kill you?
  ans:
  - in your dreams.

- que:

  ans:
  - my place.

- que:

- que:
  - you wanna stay with him after that?
  ans:
  - shit, stan.

- que:
  - wouldn't your mother be more upset if you die?
  ans:
  - the thing is, given the chance, i think he could do a good job.

- que:
  - is that a drip i hear?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you use the faucet?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - then why didn't you turn it off?
  ans:
  - i did turn it off.

- que:
  - did it occur to you it could be turned off and drip at the same time?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - it's broken?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's it.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:
  - i'm positive.

- que:
  - maybe you didn't twist it hard enough?
  ans:
  - i twisted it just right.

- que:
  - how could you be so sure?
  ans:
  - if you will look in the manual, you will see that this particular model faucet requires a range of 10 to 16 foot pounds of torque.

- que:
  - the kind used by caltech high energy physicists and nasa engineers.
  ans:
  - how could you be sure you used 16 foot pounds of torque?

- que:
  - well, in that case, how could you be sure that's accurate?
  ans:
  - here's a certificate of validation.

- que:
  - dead on balls accurate?
  ans:
  - it's an industry term.

- que:
  - miss riley, are those two young men present in the courtroom?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - now, mrs riley, is this the car?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - is this the car?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what thing?
  ans:
  - not for me to say.

- que:
  - do you have any other witnesses?
  ans:
  - no, your honour.

- que:
  - ask who questions?
  ans:
  - you knew you could ask questions.

- que:
  - didn't you, vin?
  ans:
  - if you'd put up a fight, you could have gotten the case thrown out.

- que:
  - a little?
  ans:
  - you got thrown in jail.

- que:
  - i don't need you to point it out to me, ok?
  ans:
  - you're my fiancee.

- que:
  - is that what you want?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - so shut it.

- que:
  - do you wanna go to bed?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you know what it is?
  ans:
  - i'm...

- que:
  - how the fuck did i get into this shit?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - if this was a conspiracy, they'd have to get all those people to lie.
  ans:
  - if i could keep my ass awake and outta jail long enough, betcha i could, huh?

- que:
  - do you think that's what's happening?
  ans:
  - look, i think we should meet with the public defender.

- que:
  - it is?
  ans:
  - the chair ain't working like it used to.

- que:
  - now, the evidence against you is pretty strong, so why don't you just tell me your side of the story?
  ans:
  - hey, vin.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - what was he before he was a lawyer?
  ans:
  - if he doesn't ask the right questions, your lawyer will.

- que:
  - how did he ever talk you into it?
  ans:
  - at my cousin ruthie's wedding, the groom's brother was that guy ali kazam.

- que:
  - the magician with the ponytail?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - how do i know that's not a bunch of ones with a 20 wrapped around it?

  ans:
  - i mean, the guy'll lose respect for me.

- que:
  - you think they're ok?
  ans:
  - lmagine you're a deer.

- que:
  - would you give a fuck what kind of pants the son of a bitch who shot you was wearing?

  ans:
  - i'm not a traitor.

- que:

  ans:
  - we know that you accepted payment of classified government technology.

- que:
  - look, first of all, that stuff isn't mine, ok?
  ans:
  - a mistake...

- que:
  - what is...?
  ans:
  - perfect fit.

- que:
  - you were saying?
  ans:
  - well, let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we're solving.

- que:
  - what does this have to do with me?
  ans:
  - patent applications filed this month.

- que:
  - i can't.
  ans:
  - get it?

- que:
  - you'd rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah.

- que:
  - will you help me out?
  ans:
  - they were sent three years ago.

- que:
  - who sent it?
  ans:
  - well, you did.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - twenty items.

- que:
  - what were you doing, exactly?
  ans:
  - i was eating pie.

- que:
  - was it fate?
  ans:
  - no, fate was on our side.

- que:
  - has anyone checked the machine since michael walked out of here?
  ans:
  - find him.

- que:
  - a password?
  ans:
  - new liberty savings.

- que:
  - you're saying the bank doesn't exist?
  ans:
  - that's comforting.

- que:
  - injections?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - well, you'd have some latent memories.

- que:
  - why would i have these things?
  ans:
  - explain this.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you should be asking yourself, why did you give up all that money?
  ans:
  - that's the most bizarre part of this whole thing.

- que:
  - dekker?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - william dekker?
  ans:
  - i think so.

- que:
  - what was it?
  ans:
  - well, the consensus was a laser.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because dekker's drawings called for a mirror and a lens.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - no way i get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i know what you'd spend 500 billion dollars to see.

- que:
  - can you program around the virus?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but you can find it, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, i can.

- que:
  - einstein proved that, right?
  ans:
  - time travel, yes.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he had an accident.

- que:
  - an accident?
  ans:
  - yeah, he...

- que:
  - yeah, well, it's too bad that you don't know what the rest of them are for.
  ans:
  - fell out of...?

- que:
  - close it behind you.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - go.
  ans:
  - understand?

- que:
  - where's your gun?
  ans:
  - he's got it.

- que:
  - don't remember?
  ans:
  - you brought this on yourself, mike.

- que:
  - so how does it feel knowing you're going to die?
  ans:
  - shit.

- que:
  - he designed his own escape?
  ans:
  - mr. attorney general, sir, we have no explanation.

- que:
  - you think he really saw the future?
  ans:
  - that would be something.

- que:
  - caf michel?
  ans:

- que:
  - like we're just... going through the motions, you know?

  - and i want more.

- que:
  - our politicians?

- que:
  - our priests?

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - he comes encumbered... with a wife.

- que:
  - is he gay?
  ans:
  - when he's with me, he seems to be.

- que:
  - does she know about you?
  ans:
  - i assume so.

- que:
  - she would sense it, wouldn't she?
  ans:
  - it depends on how good he is at deceiving her.

- que:
  - having a party, jane?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - did you want to join me?
  ans:
  - take this inside for mommy.

  ans:
  - he's not happy.

- que:
  - you want me to be honest?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - when are you gonna take that thing off?
  ans:
  - it's too tight.

- que:
  - what have you got to lose?
  ans:
  - just a little dignity.

- que:
  - is that really awkward?
  ans:
  - no, it's fine.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - i'm good.

- que:
  - paula?
  ans:
  - mmm.

- que:
  - she's seeing a cop now?
  ans:
  - don't be nosy, nik.

- que:
  - are her and pete getting back together or what?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what do i say then?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - the baby's sick?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - leon?
  ans:
  - oh fuck.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - should i get a doctor?
  ans:
  - i get this pain in my chest sometimes.

- que:
  - i don't have a weak heart, all right?
  ans:
  - this is not an affair, it's a one night stand that happened twice.

- que:
  - do you worry that we don't make love very often?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i love you.

- que:
  - is this a test?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:

  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - it's nothing.

- que:
  - do you think i should be?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter what i think.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - she's very needy.

- que:
  - are you trying to justify his deceit?
  ans:
  - no, i'm trying to understand it.

- que:
  - but isn't it still an act of deceit?
  ans:
  - no marriage can be based on that.

- que:
  - because i'm gay, i can't have an opinion...?
  ans:
  - it's not what i was...

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i think some women like to live the lie.

- que:
  - patrick?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what happened to your head?
  ans:
  - i bumped it on a clothes line.

- que:
  - why are you trying so hard to fuck up your life?
  ans:
  - you don't know how lucky you are to have the marriage you've got.

- que:
  - what about yours?
  ans:
  - i'm separated.

- que:
  - can you tell?
  ans:
  - no.

  ans:
  - good.

- que:
  - if there was something i should know, you'd tell me?
  ans:
  - it'd be easier.

- que:
  - so why did you and your husband split up?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - it was that simple?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - i'm wondering why... why have you been seeing me if you're still in love with your wife?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - and does that scare you?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it's not that he might have slept with another woman, you know?
  ans:
  - it's that he might not tell me.

- que:
  - valerie?
  ans:
  - patrick phelan is here.

- que:
  - would it make a difference if i were straight?
  ans:
  - i don't have a problem with your sexuality.

  ans:
  - i'm a respite from a marriage that's gotten too hard.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - he takes refuge in me.

- que:
  - what do you offer him?
  ans:
  - sex unencumbered by need.

- que:
  - why doesn't he leave her?
  ans:
  - good men don't know how to leave their wives.

- que:
  - good men or cowardly men?
  ans:
  - he told me that making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you said something to me.

- que:
  - you heard him, didn't you?
  ans:
  - this is bullshit...

- que:
  - what for?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

  - what makes a man cry like that?
  ans:
  - yeah, a lot of things.

- que:

  ans:
  - i just held him.

- que:

  ans:
  - oh shit.

- que:
  - can i have a whiskey, dry please?
  ans:
  - excuse me.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - because you haven't been around much lately.

- que:
  - what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - banning it won't solve the problem.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - you found john and valerie.

- que:
  - are you there?
  ans:
  - okay, i've had an accident.

- que:

  - locals got a call, about 12:30 am from the husband.

- que:
  - mr. somers?
  ans:
  - knox.

- que:
  - do you mind if we come in?
  ans:
  - mr. knox, it appears that your wife ran off the road.

- que:
  - should i go there?
  ans:
  - we're conducting a search, but... if she accepted a lift from somebody, it's unlikely she'll be there.

- que:
  - would you mind answering a few questions?
  ans:
  - i've been through all this with the police.

- que:
  - i know, but would you mind telling me what happened last night?
  ans:
  - i got home around midnight.

- que:
  - that's when you called the police?
  ans:
  - no, i waited about 20 minutes.

- que:
  - so you called at about 12:20?
  ans:
  - yes, more or less.

- que:
  - do you have a photo of your wife we could have, please?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - how was your wife yesterday?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - nothing troubling her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - right now, i'd say it's pretty bad, wouldn't you?
  ans:
  - none of this is particularly pleasant.

- que:
  - you're married?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - if your wife got into a stranger's car... a man, let's assume... and didn't come home, what would you imagine?
  ans:
  - right now, i'd be going mad.

- que:
  - in what sense?
  ans:
  - she's upset.

- que:
  - what's with the face?
  ans:
  - i fell over.

- que:
  - you were pissed?
  ans:
  - a little.

- que:
  - you packed your bag, hannah?
  ans:
  - quickly.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you know, don't invite nik in for coffee when i'm not here.

- que:
  - all her notes and session tapes are kept in a filing cabinet.
  ans:
  - all right?

- que:
  - do you mind?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how was she yesterday?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - is she the kind of person that would get into a stranger's car?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that ethical?
  ans:
  - probably not.

- que:
  - do you still love him?
  ans:
  - good evening.

- que:
  - why do you think she turned off the freeway?
  ans:
  - some people say it's shorter.

- que:
  - who's patrick?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what kind of trouble?
  ans:
  - she didn't go into it.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it's unprofessional.

- que:
  - even between husband and wife?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - most men hold something back.

- que:
  - you're some kind of academic, aren't you?
  ans:
  - i'm dean of law.

- que:
  - how's your marriage been lately?
  ans:
  - fine.

  - so?
  ans:
  - he comes encumbered... with a wife.

- que:

- que:
  - did you listen to phelan's tapes?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what did you think?
  ans:
  - she didn't like the man.

- que:
  - what about you?
  ans:
  - soon.

- que:
  - talked to mystery man yet?
  ans:
  - he never came back.

- que:
  - did you watch the news?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - will you find her?
  ans:
  - it's not looking good.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me?
  ans:
  - because it was private.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i'm numb.

- que:
  - why did you sleep on the couch?
  ans:
  - i came in late last night.

- que:
  - are you fighting?
  ans:
  - yeah, a bit.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - there's something we've got to sort out.

- que:
  - you all right, mom?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - can you grab something to eat?
  ans:
  - we're running late.

- que:
  - this is how you're gonna punish me?
  ans:
  - i fucked up.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i don't.

- que:
  - you know what's so easy?
  ans:
  - it's easy to go and find somebody.

- que:
  - you know what's hard?
  ans:
  - what's hard is not to.

- que:
  - hi.
  ans:
  - we'll talk about this tonight, all right?

- que:
  - pete?
  ans:
  - it's me.

- que:
  - what number is it?
  ans:
  - 406.

- que:

  ans:
  - mr. phelan, the woman's missing.

- que:
  - you know what's happened to her?
  ans:
  - not yet.

  ans:
  - fine.

- que:

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - we disagreed about something.

  - how did you know about that?
  ans:
  - that went well.

- que:
  - dylan?
  ans:
  - hi, dad.

- que:

- que:
  - what did he say?
  ans:
  - he said that he's sorry, that he loves you, and he wants you to stop being angry with him.

- que:
  - the other question is, why don't you?
  ans:
  - don't be deceived by appearances.

- que:
  - want a whiskey?
  ans:
  - somebody may have hurt your wife.

- que:
  - of what?
  ans:
  - of being alone.

- que:
  - is it an affair?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - is that what's going on?
  ans:
  - i believe that's what valerie thought was going on.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - for some reason, she believe you were involved with patrick phelan.

- que:
  - i don't have to listen to this?
  ans:
  - yes, you do.

- que:
  - what are you doing about it?
  ans:

  - i just...

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - i mean, we have to run out of places to put this stuff eventually.

- que:
  - do you remember that?
  ans:
  - yes, i remember.

- que:
  - do you have any idea what may have triggered this concern?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - well, last week we were talking about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities.

- que:
  - yeah, but how many people do you think run around obsessing over how great and how happy things are?
  ans:
  - you know, i mean, maybe they do, but i don't think they're in therapy.

- que:
  - is this a mistake?
  ans:
  - depends on your point of view.

- que:
  - how about 7. 30?
  ans:
  - yeah, fine.

- que:
  - yes, sir?
  ans:
  - janet.

- que:
  - are you still keeping these thoughts from john?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are you afraid of his finding you silly at thinking these things?
  ans:
  - no, it's not that.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - he invited this college friend of his to stay at our house and didn't even ask me.

- que:
  - what upsets you about that?
  ans:
  - it's his house.

- que:
  - this unexpected guest notwithstanding, how are things with john?
  ans:
  - oh, they're fine.

- que:
  - when did you begin having this feeling?
  ans:
  - well... last week.

- que:
  - prior to this feeling, were you comfortable with contact with john?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - it seemed so stupid, especially when you don't know what to do with the garbage.
  ans:
  - did you do anything?

- que:
  - oh, so it was recently when you tried this?
  ans:
  - oh, well, it was kind of recently, but not... real recently.

  ans:
  - first sexual experience.

- que:
  - is this the kinda thing that...?

  - what kind of questions?
  ans:
  - questions... about... sex.

- que:
  - well, what did he ask, exactly?
  ans:
  - well, i don't wanna tell you, exactly.

- que:
  - you let a total stranger record your sexual life, but you won't tell your own sister?
  ans:
  - apparently.

- que:
  - did he ask me to take my clothes off?
  ans:
  - no, he didn't.

- que:
  - did you take your clothes off?
  ans:
  - because i wanted to.

- que:
  - but why did you want to?
  ans:
  - because i wanted him to see me.

- que:
  - did he touch you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you touch him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did anybody touch anybody?
  ans:
  - well, yes.

- que:
  - you didn't do it, i did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
  ans:
  - i don't wanna talk about it.

- que:
  - ex cuse me?
  ans:
  - you're just an errand boy, sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

- que:
  - that's pretty good, isn't it?
  ans:
  - marlon brando.

- que:
  - so, why don't you get an answering machine?
  ans:
  - there's a phone here.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - it's a sundress.

- que:
  - why would she want a sundress?
  ans:

  ans:
  - showing me a present she and i are buying your mother in law.

  - ok.

- que:
  - john?
  ans:

- que:
  - so, who'd you have lunch with?
  ans:
  - i ate by myself.

- que:
  - well, are you?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not.

- que:
  - is that who it is?
  ans:
  - ann, i'm not fucking your sister.

- que:
  - is that supposed to comfort me?
  ans:
  - no, i'm just saying.

- que:
  - then why don't i believe you?
  ans:
  - oh, look.

- que:
  - there's evidence?
  ans:
  - that's not what i'm saying.

- que:
  - i mean, can you imagine?
  ans:
  - your honour, i'm positive the man is guilty.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - what's so stupid about it?
  ans:
  - well, you...

- que:
  - do you think he can be trusted?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
  ans:
  - john, we are not talking about military secrets here.

- que:
  - they just talk?
  ans:
  - they just sit around and talk.

- que:
  - interact?
  ans:
  - whatever that means.

- que:
  - did you have to masturbate in front of him?
  ans:
  - i felt like it.

- que:
  - you told ann about this?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - you realise you have no recourse legally?
  ans:
  - it's not funny.

- que:
  - you trust him?
  ans:
  - that's funny.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - just what i said.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - look, are we gonna do it or not?
  ans:
  - actually... no.

- que:
  - well, why don't you go sit somewhere else?
  ans:
  - come on, john.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - graham.

- que:
  - want something to drink?
  ans:
  - yeah, thanks.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how did you know?
  ans:
  - she said it on her tape.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because it's not really my place.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because i don't think it's a choice that you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

- que:
  - and what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
  ans:
  - that's a good question.

- que:
  - so, what do you have to do to get ready?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - so, where do you get your money from, for rent, and tapes, and stuff like that?
  ans:
  - underneath my mattress.

- que:
  - and what are you gonna do when this money runs out?
  ans:
  - it won't.

- que:
  - are you comfortable there?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm comfortable.

- que:
  - this afternoon?
  ans:
  - uh...

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - i want out of this marriage.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i... want... out... of this marriage.

- que:
  - you're asking me why?
  ans:
  - i'm married to you and you want out of this marriage.

- que:
  - can you tell me where you went?
  ans:
  - i drove around.

- que:
  - graham's?
  ans:
  - graham.

- que:
  - well, i know you didn't fuck him.
  ans:
  - oh, mr honesty, huh?

- que:
  - did you make one of these goddamn videotapes?
  ans:
  - annie... answer me, goddammit.

- que:
  - did you?
  ans:
  - yes, i did.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - ok, i'm recording.

- que:
  - what do you usually talk about?
  ans:
  - sex.

- que:
  - do you have sex?
  ans:
  - not very often, no.

- que:
  - when you do, who usually initiates it?
  ans:
  - he does.

- que:
  - is the sex satisfying?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you have orgasms?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband?
  ans:
  - here we go.

- que:
  - why don't we stop?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you ever thought about having sex with someone other than your husband?
  ans:
  - i've thought about it.

- que:
  - did you act on it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because that's how cynthia thinks.

- que:
  - what other men have you thought about?
  ans:
  - i thought about you.

- que:
  - have you thought about me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what did you think?
  ans:
  - i thought about what you would look like having an orgasm.

- que:
  - give a woman an orgasm?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - could you do that for me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because i can't.

- que:
  - can't or won't?
  ans:
  - i can't because i won't.

- que:
  - was it so bad it turned you off, or...?
  ans:
  - no, that wasn't the problem.

- que:
  - what was the problem?
  ans:
  - i was the problem.

- que:
  - you lied?
  ans:
  - that was part of it.

- que:
  - so, what else happened?
  ans:
  - well, at that time, uh...

- que:
  - are you still like that?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're never gonna make love again?
  ans:
  - i don't...

- que:
  - if you were in love with me, would you?
  ans:
  - i'm not in love with you.

- que:
  - but if you were?
  ans:
  - i can't answer that.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i told you.

- que:
  - ann, forget about the sex, you know?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - is that who it is?
  ans:
  - i guess.

- que:
  - with elizabeth?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - but you're gonna tell her about them, right, since you don't lie any more?
  ans:
  - as i said, i don't know what i'm gonna do, exactly.

- que:
  - so, you just came back here so that you could think about it?
  ans:
  - no, i moved back here for some...

- que:
  - a sense of closure, you know?
  ans:
  - resolution of some sort.

  ans:
  - my point is, if we can't beat their defences, then we gotta get around them.

- que:
  - how did you do that?
  ans:
  - i gave it a cold.

- que:
  - are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields?
  ans:
  - just like they used our satellites against us, we can use their own signal against them.

- que:
  - how exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus?
  ans:
  - eh...

- que:
  - you want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes?
  ans:
  - with shields down, it might be possible.

  ans:
  - well, i'm russell casse, sir.

- que:
  - don't you think that's cutting it too close?
  ans:
  - we're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off.

- que:
  - i may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.
  ans:
  - why you?

- que:
  - hey, you know how i'm always trying to save the planet?
  ans:
  - here's my chance.

- que:
  - how do i look?

  ans:
  - they seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - and i suppose she's made it over the mountains on a bike by now?
  ans:
  - it couldn't be these bozos.

- que:
  - see you around, kaneda.
  ans:
  - you'll help anyone so long as it's a girl, won't you?

- que:
  - it may have begun with the shock of contact with number 26, or possibly...
  ans:
  - you're leaving already?

- que:
  - have you finished running a comparison with akira's pattern?
  ans:
  - i'll superimpose it over this one.

- que:
  - is it safe?
  ans:
  - well, if we use the latest examination equipment to collect even more data...... and do a multifaceted analysis, then surely...

- que:
  - the power of god?
  ans:
  - shut the hell up.

- que:
  - yeah.
  ans:
  - let me guess, jaws from p. e.?

- que:
  - and that idiot tetsuo had an accident, too.
  ans:
  - those guys are so gross!

- que:
  - what happened to tetsuo?
  ans:
  - he's in the hospital, i guess, but we don't know where.

- que:
  - tetsuo?
  ans:
  - it's time for your medication.

- que:

- que:
  - all systems nominal, then?
  ans:
  - look at what they abandoned in their panic.

- que:
  - don't kick yourself over it, okay?
  ans:
  - well, i guess saying i'm kei's boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

- que:
  - is he really okay?
  ans:
  - all i know for sure is that he's not a spy.

- que:
  - what's the objective?
  ans:
  - detailed data on the new subject.

- que:
  - new subject?
  ans:
  - that's an intriguing story.

- que:
  - will you be taking the boy with you?
  ans:
  - colonel, we can no longer leave the peace...... of neo tokyo to your sole discretion.

- que:
  - isn't that cable replacement scheduled for next week?

  ans:
  - looks like they've beefed up security.

- que:
  - scout around some?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you okay?
  ans:
  - why, you...

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - there's a freight elevator.

- que:
  - you thought you could kill me?
  ans:
  - your power isn't fully matured.

- que:
  - damn, that hurt...
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - all you have to do is ask, kanny.
  ans:
  - kaneda?

- que:
  - he...
  ans:
  - say what?

- que:
  - kiyoko, are you okay?
  ans:
  - it doesn't look like she's hurt.

- que:

  ans:
  - you're bleeding.

- que:
  - what happened to him?
  ans:
  - he flew away.

- que:
  - is anyone here?
  ans:
  - he's developed so much power in such a short time...

- que:
  - please come with us.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - you expect me to hand neo tokyo over to those fools at a time like this?
  ans:
  - everybody's been worried.

- que:
  - so, you feeling better?
  ans:
  - gimme some... capsules.

- que:
  - and the checkpoints are so strict, even the clowns are staying put.
  ans:
  - hey, are you sure about that?

- que:
  - a fish out of water dies, huh?
  ans:
  - you are tetsuo...

- que:
  - aren't you?
  ans:
  - kaneda sends his regards.

- que:
  - you did this, tetsuo?
  ans:
  - so anyway...

- que:
  - shit...
  ans:
  - where's kaneda's bike?

- que:
  - he went to where akira is?
  ans:
  - that's what that girl said.

- que:
  - it has something to do with that power of tetsuo's, right?
  ans:
  - ryu told me about it once.

- que:
  - humans do all kinds of things during their lifetime, right?
  ans:
  - discovering things, building things...

- que:
  - humans were like monkeys once, right?
  ans:
  - and before that, like reptiles and fish.

- que:
  - if that's true, what memories are hidden in it?
  ans:
  - the beginning of the universe, maybe.

- que:
  - did you get hit on the head back there?
  ans:
  - maybe everyone has those memories.

- que:
  - that's what akira is?
  ans:
  - amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

- que:
  - the door's unlocked.
  ans:
  - that's what tetsuo's doing?

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - this has got to be a trap.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - it can't be helped.

- que:
  - what're you gonna do?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, sir...

- que:
  - is this for real?
  ans:
  - what you see here seems to be fires caused by tank cannons.

- que:
  - he wants this, doesn't he?
  ans:
  - we should call the gang together.

- que:
  - you shouldn't use your power this way.
  ans:
  - wha?

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - yeah, but i already took care of it.

- que:
  - well, did you hit him?
  ans:
  - we're too close to the impact point.

- que:
  - what the?
  ans:
  - they say it's sol.

- que:
  - when tetsuo's power reaches its peak?
  ans:
  - that's when we do it.

- que:
  - but will it work?
  ans:
  - the future doesn't proceed along a single course.

- que:
  - what's tetsuo's status?
  ans:
  - ah.

- que:
  - tetsuo?
  ans:
  - he never existed in the first place.

- que:
  - medicine...
  ans:
  - what's wrong?

- que:
  - did you hear that, doctor?
  ans:
  - yes, colonel.

- que:
  - can you see any signs of it?
  ans:
  - i'm not entirely certain, but it seems that the power that had been held back by the drugs is breaking free.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - son of a...

- que:
  - akira...
  ans:
  - what are you doing here?
