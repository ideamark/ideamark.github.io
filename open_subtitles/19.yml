  ans:
  - i have a message for your wife.

- que:
  - and how are the dear saxons taking the news, sir guy?
  ans:
  - they're even more worried than longchamps, your highness.

- que:
  - whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured...... and leave all of england to my tender care?
  ans:
  - he may disapprove when he returns, your highness.

- que:
  - that's all you saxons think about.
  ans:
  - but who's gonna pay me?

- que:
  - the rest remain here.
  ans:
  - didn't i tell you it was for prince john, who's just come up from london?

- que:
  - what's your name, you saxon dog?
  ans:
  - a better one than yours.

- que:
  - what's your name?
  ans:
  - much, the miller's son.

- que:
  - you know it's death to kill the king's deer?
  ans:
  - come now, sir guy.

- que:
  - you'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
  ans:
  - lf it amused me, yes.

- que:
  - by what right do you interfere with justice?
  ans:
  - by a better right than you have to misuse it.

- que:
  - eh, will?
  ans:
  - yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.

- que:
  - what's his fault?
  ans:
  - he's killed a royal deer.

- que:
  - are there no exceptions?
  ans:
  - thanks, good master.

- que:
  - was it worthwhile coming with me from london...... to see what stout fellows our nottingham friends are?
  ans:
  - take sir guy of gisbourne, now.

- que:
  - why, you like him, don't you?
  ans:
  - well, he's a norman, of course.

- que:
  - lsn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian?
  ans:
  - oh, nay, i'd not force you, my lady.

- que:
  - with a saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and charnwood?
  ans:
  - well said, sir knight.

- que:
  - who is that?
  ans:
  - sir robin of locksley.

- que:
  - sir rob sir robin of locksley?
  ans:
  - why, i've heard precious little else since i've been here.

- que:
  - what's his latest outrage?
  ans:
  - oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in sherwood forest today.

- que:
  - and you didn't take him?
  ans:
  - that would have been a problem, your highness.

- que:
  - a saxon a problem?
  ans:
  - he's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - well, he's the deadliest archer in england, and....

- que:
  - who is this, this...?
  ans:
  - sir robin of locksley, your highness.

- que:
  - run out of hangings?
  ans:
  - i know a ripe subject for one.

- que:
  - i hope my lady had a pleasant journey from london?
  ans:
  - what you hope can hardly be important.

- que:
  - you hear that, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - here's gisbourne so in love with marian he daren't say\"boo\"to her...... and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends.

- que:
  - have you had meat?
  ans:
  - none but what i brought.

- que:
  - bring sir robin food at once, do you hear?
  ans:
  - such impudence must support a mighty appetite.

- que:
  - so you think you're overtaxed, eh?
  ans:
  - overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope.

- que:
  - oh, you're not?
  ans:
  - as you may know, my brother is a prisoner of leopold of austria.

- que:
  - why to you, your highness?
  ans:
  - king richard appointed longchamps regent.

- que:
  - you, sir mortimer of leeds?
  ans:
  - not i, your highness.

- que:
  - you, sir boron?
  ans:
  - nor i, your highness.

- que:
  - you, sir ralf of durham?
  ans:
  - my sword is yours, your highness.

- que:
  - have you no stomach for honest meat?
  ans:
  - for honest meat, yes.

- que:
  - you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune...... to seize his power?
  ans:
  - and now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats...... you'il try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless saxon.

- que:
  - and what do you propose to do?
  ans:
  - i'il organize revolt.

- que:
  - have you finished?
  ans:
  - there, through the gate.

- que:
  - ... the sooner you begin collecting the  the ransom, your highness?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, of course.

- que:
  - after a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
  ans:
  - i've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

- que:
  - hooting?
  ans:
  - he was singing you to sleep.

- que:
  - i'il get myself a staff.
  ans:
  - aren't you man enough?

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - this quarterstaff master.

- que:
  - what's your name, friend?
  ans:
  - john little.

- que:
  - what's yours?
  ans:
  - robin.

- que:
  - not robin of locksley?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - he'il die if we lash him again, my lord.
  ans:
  - are you with me?

- que:
  - oh, he'il die, will he?
  ans:
  - yes, but i couldn't find him.

- que:
  - what chance has anyone of finding him?
  ans:
  - every villager and woodcutter's his friend.

- que:
  - do you question my valor?
  ans:
  - i only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - i live in the forest with good fellows who've everything in life save spiritual guidance.

- que:
  - and what's that?
  ans:
  - we're outlaws.

- que:
  - come now, fat one.
  ans:
  - on my back?

- que:
  - why don't you give up?
  ans:
  - you can see i'm a better swordsman.

- que:
  - must we go on, then?
  ans:
  - i think we're even now, friar.

- que:
  - even?
  ans:
  - nay.

- que:
  - you'il join us?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - robin.

- que:
  - aye?
  ans:
  - i've got word  it's all right.

- que:
  - one of us?
  ans:
  - he looks like three of us.

- que:
  - what's it, will?
  ans:
  - sir guy of gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight.

- que:
  - when does he enter sherwood?
  ans:
  - tomorrow.

- que:
  - are you ready, men?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - see anything of them?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - ls everything ready?
  ans:
  - they'il think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest.

- que:
  - afraid?
  ans:
  - certainly not, sir.

- que:
  - oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.
  ans:
  - are you sure?

- que:
  - well, you old rooster, what do you see?
  ans:
  - make ready.

- que:
  - do you see sir guy?
  ans:
  - he's leading the second.

- que:
  - what, sir guy, no greeting from you?
  ans:
  - why, that's curious.

- que:
  - fighting?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.

- que:
  - have we, men?
  ans:
  - we only want to stroke his pretty neck.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - well, let's away.

- que:
  - or ladies?
  ans:
  - she means you.

- que:
  - a hedge robber?
  ans:
  - i ain't never been out walking...

- que:
  - what female?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life?
  ans:
  - you don't know what you missed, my lad.

- que:
  - aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves?
  ans:
  - i think it's revolting.

- que:
  - your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite.

- que:
  - a little mutton, my lady?
  ans:
  - i said i'm not hungry.

- que:
  - he provides us with this tasty supper.
  ans:
  - well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you?

- que:
  - yes.
  ans:
  - and is this the end of his beneficence?

- que:
  - i suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to richard?
  ans:
  - i may have been hasty....

- que:
  - or of me, perhaps?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid of nothing.

- que:
  - have you eaten well, friend?
  ans:
  - yes, thank you, robin hood.

- que:
  - because i can feel for beaten, helpless people?
  ans:
  - no, you're strange because you want to do something about it.

- que:
  - what's that matter?
  ans:
  - it's injustice i hate, not the normans.

- que:
  - you just don't understand, do you?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - yes, master?
  ans:
  - take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the nottingham road.

- que:
  - with your permission, my lady?
  ans:
  - goodbye, my lady.

- que:
  - he took everything you had collected?
  ans:
  - every silver penny.

- que:
  - what did your highness expect?
  ans:
  - with the lady marian in our company and locksley's men outnumbering us.

- que:
  - lf i may be so bold as to inquire?
  ans:
  - mind your words, gisbourne.

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - that's marvelous.

- que:
  - think he'd forgo shooting...... against the archers of all england?
  ans:
  - we'il give a prize.

- que:
  - and ask him to risk his neck for that?
  ans:
  - that won't be the only bait, with the lady marian presenting the arrow herself.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - when they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly.

- que:
  - and didn't you notice how his eyes never left her?
  ans:
  - the man who wins the golden arrow will be robin hood.

- que:
  - will you take that bonnet off?
  ans:
  - i hope our little golden hook will catch the fish.

- que:
  - you hope?
  ans:
  - oh, it will if he's here.

- que:
  - are your men sure of their orders?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - well, what of it?
  ans:
  - you know what'il happen if they do.

- que:
  - where's your sporting blood?
  ans:
  - sir guy accepted our invitation.

- que:
  - where's your love of fights, risk, adventure?
  ans:
  - well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, i'il have to see him through.

- que:
  - lady marian?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - and if i had, what interest could a tinker have for me?
  ans:
  - phillip of arras shoots next.

- que:
  - what is your name, archer?
  ans:
  - godfrey of sherwood, your highness.

- que:
  - how is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms?
  ans:
  - even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things.

- que:
  - how is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
  ans:
  - that's my court of last resort, sir guy.

- que:
  - haven't you forgotten a count or two?
  ans:
  - surely it's a crime under the noble prince john to love one's country.

- que:
  - ls it the outlaw?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - why, my lady, how should i know?
  ans:
  - don't put me off.

- que:
  - you've been seeing him?
  ans:
  - yes, my lady.

- que:
  - do you want to send a message?
  ans:
  - to his men, yes.

- que:
  - oh, dear....
  ans:
  - where was it?

- que:
  - but there must be some way  lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?
  ans:
  - why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it.

- que:
  - what is it, prin?
  ans:
  - a lady, sir.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's a trap, will.

- que:
  - ls she alone?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - what do you want, my lady?
  ans:
  - i want to help him.

- que:
  - how did you find us here?
  ans:
  - never mind that now.

- que:
  - what's to prevent your killing me if? ls there no one here with sense enough to see?
  ans:
  - one moment.

- que:
  - you swear by our lady that you want to help robin?
  ans:
  - i swear, good father.

- que:
  - have you thought of a way?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - can you get us in the castle?
  ans:
  - that's no good.

- que:
  - yes, isn't it?
  ans:
  - with locksley out of the way, we'il stamp out the rest.

- que:
  - won't it be a pleasant surprise for prince john when he returns?
  ans:
  - here i am.

- que:
  - tell me, when you are in love, is it...... well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

- que:
  - does it make you want to be with him all the time?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...... like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine?
  ans:
  - then there's not a doubt of it.

- que:
  - keep quiet, bess.
  ans:
  - doubt of what?

- que:
  - why did you come here?
  ans:
  - to see you.

- que:
  - but don't you realize that?
  ans:
  - of course, i probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl.

- que:
  - now, let's see, where does this game begin?
  ans:
  - oh, i know.

- que:
  - you are, aren't you?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - don't you?
  ans:
  - you know i do.

- que:
  - i'il go.
  ans:
  - do you know you're very impudent?

- que:
  - to sherwood?
  ans:
  - i've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger, but we'd be together.

- que:
  - will you?
  ans:
  - because i love you, robin, i'd come.

- que:
  - then you will?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you remember that day in sherwood forest?
  ans:
  - i realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right...... and that we were wrong.

- que:
  - now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone?
  ans:
  - go now, quickly, dearest.

- que:
  - you gentlemen have traveled far?
  ans:
  - yes, quite a distance.

- que:
  - how is that?
  ans:
  - the bishop of the black canons.

- que:
  - do you wish to go on after dinner?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - they burst on us from ambush.
  ans:
  - what happened, your grace?

- que:
  - who did?
  ans:
  - why, robin hood, of course.

- que:
  - you've heard of him, then?
  ans:
  - oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

- que:
  - oh, then you're strange to this shire?
  ans:
  - more or less.

- que:
  - what might be your names, gentlemen?
  ans:
  - they're hardly important enough to deserve your interest.

- que:
  - landlord, where's our ale?
  ans:
  - coming, sirs.

- que:
  - will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight?
  ans:
  - we hadn't decided, your grace.

- que:
  - what would you advise?
  ans:
  - let's to sleep, then.

- que:
  - did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in?
  ans:
  - i've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned.

- que:
  - and you're sure it was richard?
  ans:
  - go on, gisbourne.

- que:
  - who's to...?
  ans:
  - dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs...... over some little mischance.

- que:
  - you know this tavern?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - am i not right?
  ans:
  - with the manor and estate of robin of locksley to support his rank.

- que:
  - when shall i start?
  ans:
  - lmmediately.

- que:
  - how many men will you need?
  ans:
  - you're a clever fellow, gisbourne.

- que:
  - do you suppose she heard?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why should i be?
  ans:
  - oh, come now, my dear lady marian.

- que:
  - how did locksley and his men arrange his escape...... from hanging after the archery match?
  ans:
  - someone here in the castle must have got word to him.

- que:
  - are you not ashamed, my lady marian?
  ans:
  - yes, i am.

- que:
  - sorry?
  ans:
  - i'd do it again if you kill me for it.

- que:
  - have you got it all in your stupid head now?
  ans:
  - of course i have.

- que:
  - robin will look after her, all right.
  ans:
  - bess, where was dickon supposed to find king richard?

- que:
  - where's dickon heading for?
  ans:
  - kent road tavern.

- que:
  - kent road tavern?
  ans:
  - you can save three miles and cut him off through low wood.

- que:
  - oh, you will be careful, won't you?
  ans:
  - too far to be patient with delay now.

- que:
  - you see, sir abbot?
  ans:
  - we're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer...... while you have property, rents, and silver.

- que:
  - are you friendly to our good king richard?
  ans:
  - i love no man better.

- que:
  - then i can go free?
  ans:
  - any friend of richard's is free of this forest.

- que:
  - would you honor us by sharing meat with us?
  ans:
  - gladly.

- que:
  - well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
  ans:
  - those i kill died from misusing the trust that richard left them.

- que:
  - you'd condemn holy crusades?
  ans:
  - prince john sent dickon to kent road tavern last night to kill the king.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - i don't know, master.

- que:
  - understand?
  ans:
  - you don't need to search for richard, robin.

- que:
  - sire, prince john's calling bishop of the black canons...... to proclaim him king in nottingham tomorrow.
  ans:
  - what do you mean?

- que:
  - how'd you learn this?
  ans:
  - without an army it'il be much too strong.

- que:
  - your sword, gisbourne.
  ans:
  - ls it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother...... richard the lion heart of england?

- que:
  - what about you, robin?
  ans:
  - my sword is yours, sire, now and always.

- que:
  - ls there nothing the king can grant the outlaw...... who showed him his duty to his country?
  ans:
  - there's but one thing else, sire.

- que:
  - and do you too wish...?
  ans:
  - more than anything in the world, sire.

- que:
  - percy?
  ans:
  - not right now.

- que:
  - what kind of question is that, \"you got a woman in here?
  ans:
  - i didn't know.

- que:
  - now she wants us to renew our vows.
  ans:
  - vows?

- que:
  - i did, didn't i?
  ans:
  - yes, you did.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i think it's cool you're just doing the lyrics from that song.

- que:
  - you wrote that on the way to work?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - were you listening to the radio when you wrote it?
  ans:
  - cause i think it's b2k.

- que:
  - see your sexy smile and bump, bump?
  ans:
  - three bumps.

- que:
  - did i hear theresa's bringing a new boyfriend to your anniversary party?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm fine with it.

- que:
  - so, you met him?
  ans:
  - nope.

- que:
  - theresa?
  ans:
  - i don't believe it.

- que:
  - this guy didn't seem to care, did he?
  ans:
  - every investment i've made in the last six months.

  ans:
  - i'il tell you about it later.

- que:
  - it's a good thing i do then, huh?
  ans:
  - theresa, a man is never excited about meeting his future father in law.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it was your idea.

- que:
  - at that wedding, was a woman involved?
  ans:
  - of course it involved a woman.

- que:
  - so, percy, which one do you like best?
  ans:
  - i like that...

- que:
  - which one costs the most?
  ans:
  - they cost the same.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - well, that's too bad, 'cause i'm wearing this one.

- que:
  - yeah?
  ans:
  - listen.

- que:
  - why do you even bother asking me?
  ans:
  - cause it's a big day for us and i wanted you to feel included.

- que:
  - why couldn't you include martha superfreak out there?
  ans:
  - dante is a nice man.

- que:
  - would you open your mind, percy jones?
  ans:
  - dante is a metrosexual.

  ans:
  - he's a straight man with taste.

- que:
  - this boy that theresa's bringing home?
  ans:
  - i don't know who his people are, where he's from...

- que:
  - you pulled his credit report?
  ans:
  - i did not.

- que:
  - you pulled his credit report, percy?
  ans:
  - i mean, i glanced at it.

- que:

  - let's just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks.

- que:
  - she's pretty intense, huh?
  ans:
  - no shit, man.

- que:
  - you're going back?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you think i don't care about lewis?
  ans:
  - that's what you're acting like.

- que:
  - then how come you're so ready to slam the door on him?
  ans:
  - i know something about guys who have clubs and badges.

- que:
  - you think of that?
  ans:
  - this is the other side of the coin.

- que:
  - if this goes down, god forbid, and lewis hangs, you don't think this is gonna be headline news?
  ans:
  - sheriff, this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life.

- que:
  - whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade?
  ans:
  - tony, you're a fucking boy scout.

- que:
  - listen to me, ok?
  ans:
  - lewis would have gone back for either of us.

- que:
  - beth eastern?
  ans:

  ans:
  - a reporter.

- que:
  - and what would you want with me?
  ans:
  - come on, beth.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - in this instance, your interests and the interests of the public converge.

- que:
  - how did you find out about this?
  ans:
  - my sources at the state department.

- que:
  - the american kid who graffitied a car?
  ans:
  - because of the media frenzy, they had to cane the kid.

- que:
  - you know what happened?
  ans:
  - they hung her son a week early to shut her up.

- que:
  - just...
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - is he clean cut?
  ans:
  - cos if i put him on the front page...

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - soon.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - i'm gonna watch this.

  ans:

- que:

  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:

  ans:
  - i've never had a beer with him.

- que:
  - oh, sheriff, what do you think about me?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - would you go back?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't ask you or tony to do this if i hadn't already answered the question for myself.

- que:
  - i'm not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john, all right?
  ans:
  - he'il fuck you and then sneak out, by the fire escape if he has to.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - fuck you for not wearing a ring.

- que:
  - ok?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - long time, huh?
  ans:
  - i guess if you're seeing this tape you've kind of figured that my vacation plans... changed.

- que:
  - kind of ironic, isn't it?
  ans:
  - look who's caged and... they say soon to be extinct.

- que:
  - pop, remember that trip i took a couple of years back, to malaysia?
  ans:
  - yeah, i remember.

- que:
  - some sleaze was selling frequent flyer miles, right?
  ans:
  - that's not the point.

- que:
  - you still want my advice in this hanging stuff?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  ans:
  - i represent a boy sentenced to death.

  - where's the document that guarantees this deal?
  ans:
  - the attorney general of malaysia has agreed...

- que:
  - why don't we have a copy?
  ans:
  - it's an oral agreement.

  ans:
  - i think you make a great girl.

- que:

- que:
  - tell me, lieutenant, did you actually see it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and can you describe what you saw?
  ans:
  - yes, it was like the fin of a huge creature.

- que:
  - yeah, but who can prove that it was godzilla?
  ans:
  - even if it was godzilla, it hasn't been seen for 50 years.

- que:
  - why would it choose to come back here?
  ans:
  - it doesn't make any sense.

- que:
  - why should it choose japan again?
  ans:
  - nobody can answer that question...... but we have to be ready for the worst scenario.

- que:
  - couldn't he have picked on some other country?
  ans:
  - whenever we increase our defense spending...... we're accused of depleting the government's resources.

- que:
  - you know him?
  ans:
  - i saw him at mount myoko.

- que:
  - mount myoko in niigata prefecture?
  ans:
  - must be a mistake.

- que:
  - oh, by the way, have you visited our website yet?
  ans:
  - yes, it's very interesting.

- que:
  - ghidorah?
  ans:
  - you must wake the thousand year old dragon...... before it's too late.

- que:
  - do you think that ghidorah is alive?
  ans:
  - only 2000 years have gone by.

- que:
  - yuri, what do you have there?
  ans:
  - i'm sure that old man must have put it here.

- que:
  - what makes you say it was him?
  ans:
  - just a hunch, it's a feeling.

- que:
  - hey, where's that?
  ans:
  - oh, the old lady here told me about those.

- que:
  - this animal represents the collective will to survive...... of many thousands of people.
  ans:
  - yeah, but i thought that the army killed godzilla, right?

- que:
  - say, yuri, do you really believe the old fart, huh?
  ans:
  - he's not making it up, i know that.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - that's interesting.

- que:
  - why does it want to destroy us?
  ans:
  - because the japanese people want to forget what happened.

- que:
  - it seems to have been due to a landslide.
  ans:
  - what?

- que:
  - can you see any survivors?
  ans:
  - we'il make another low pass and check.

- que:
  - you follow me?
  ans:
  - if spirits are another form of electricity...... maybe there's a way for them to be stored in stone.

- que:
  - i don't understand.
  ans:
  - but why would he want to do it?

- que:
  - why attack us, then?
  ans:
  - well, what they're defending is our homeland.

- que:
  - and you really believe that rubbish?
  ans:
  - all i can say, father, is his story's believable.

- que:
  - do you have a better story?
  ans:
  - but one thing i don't understand...... is our soldiers died for their country.

- que:
  - so why do they now want to destroy japan?
  ans:
  - but so many other people suffered all over asia.

- que:
  - don't you see?
  ans:
  - i've just returned from the bonins.

- que:
  - they've canceled everything?
  ans:
  - we're to maintain our surveillance.

- que:
  - do you think we should issue another warning?
  ans:
  - i recorded it for my own use.

- que:
  - then you should be able to convince him...... about the guardian monsters, shouldn't you?
  ans:
  - yeah, well, dad's also a navy commander.

- que:
  - well, if you're sure about it, why not put it on your website?
  ans:
  - but i'm telling you, it's true.

- que:
  - the monster has come up.
  ans:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - a guardian monster or godzilla?
  ans:
  - the monster is at least 30 meters long.

- que:
  - not godzilla?
  ans:
  - the information we're receiving is still pretty confused.

- que:
  - the anti godzilla plan?
  ans:
  - negative.

- que:
  - get the lines ready.
  ans:
  - what do you mean?

- que:
  - ready to go, sir.
  ans:
  - what's going on?

- que:
  - evacuate?
  ans:
  - godzilla is just a legend.

- que:
  - an atom bomb?
  ans:
  - yuri.

- que:
  - so you're not afraid?
  ans:
  - no, i want to see it.

- que:
  - have you got the stone?
  ans:
  - in my bag.

- que:
  - you think it's an amulet?
  ans:
  - i think i've found where that monster's heading.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - i think it's heading towards godzilla.

- que:
  - godzilla?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, near hakone.

- que:
  - but can we be sure he's heading this way?
  ans:
  - i'm certain he is.

- que:
  - why always here?
  ans:
  - baragon sighted, sir, at hakone.

- que:
  - i think the monsters are gonna fight.
  ans:
  - have they managed to evacuate everybody yet?

- que:
  - there are still hundreds of people in the area.
  ans:

- que:
  - look, haven't you done enough, yuri?
  ans:

  ans:
  - if the boss asks, i said it's okay.

- que:
  - contact lost...
  ans:
  - \"bargain basement of the airwaves\"?

- que:
  - well, sir?
  ans:
  - at the time, i doubted it...... but i taught my men to be proud of what they did.

- que:
  - if people knew the true story...... then our defense forces would have faced ridicule.
  ans:
  - i wonder, was it worth it?

- que:
  - hence, the need for the utmost secrecy, understand?
  ans:
  - so i'm relying on your discretion.

- que:
  - cmdr. tachibana, do you have a daughter called yuri?
  ans:
  - yes, that's right.

- que:
  - do we know where it is now?
  ans:
  - it's heading east from mount fuji.

- que:
  - what's going to happen, commander?
  ans:
  - the guardian monsters are gathering.

- que:
  - why not name the monsters so we don't get them mixed up, general?
  ans:
  - it would make things easier, sir.

- que:
  - ghidorah?
  ans:
  - the guardian monsters are here.

- que:
  - what the hell's going on out there?
  ans:
  - a couple, sir.

- que:
  - my father?
  ans:
  - the captain says you can't stay here, miss.

- que:
  - why the commander?
  ans:
  - he's a commander, a senior officer.

- que:
  - why does he have to go himself?
  ans:
  - because i have the most experience.

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - sure, i understand.

- que:
  - is there a soldier there?
  ans:
  - pass him to me.

- que:
  - commander?
  ans:
  - soldier...... give the lady carte blanche.

- que:
  - ghidorah has been beaten.
  ans:
  - what for?

- que:
  - contact lost.
  ans:
  - baragon?

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - he came back.

- que:
  - do you read, salvage sub 2?
  ans:
  - i read you.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - professor isayama died a long time ago...... after the first godzilla attack, in fact.

- que:

  ans:
  - whoever he was, he's gone from the tape.

- que:
  - good morning.
  ans:
  - are you all right?

- que:
  - are we there yet?
  ans:
  - hell, you woke up just in time for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

- que:
  - listen, i'm no expert, but wouldn't a couch in a headshrinker's office be more comfortable?
  ans:
  - well, she's not the only one who needed change.

- que:
  - my god, people still use those things?
  ans:
  - i like to hear what i'm typing.

- que:
  - do you think it's...?
  ans:
  - okay, give it a try.

- que:
  - shaping up, huh?
  ans:
  - i was thinking tomorrow i'd start up on the book.

- que:
  - what was?
  ans:
  - the\"fishing\"for the... never mind.

- que:
  - don't you think we've had enough time off in the last two years?
  ans:
  - but we just got here.

- que:
  - how about you?
  ans:
  - i'm going to need more water.

- que:
  - the turn carriage on the underwood is, shall i say, faulty?
  ans:
  - you think the way those things are built you could drop it off a 10 story building and it'd still type out\"war and peace.

- que:
  - how about duck?
  ans:
  - you know, chantrelle's has claim to the finest duck fricassee in all of new york's grandiose french fare.

- que:
  - would you put that away?

  ans:
  - if you want rice, we're going to need more water.

  - what?
  ans:

  - 10 years living together in the city, you don't even like to carry pepper spray in your purse, molly.
  ans:
  - where are they?

- que:
  - pills can be just pumped from your stomach.
  ans:
  - and now... what?

- que:
  - is that right?
  ans:
  - i did not know that.

- que:
  - anybody out there?
  ans:
  - don't move.

- que:
  - what are you doing to her?
  ans:
  - well, nothing that concerns you.

- que:
  - you hear what i said?
  ans:
  - i asked you...

- que:
  - come again?
  ans:
  - i want you to take those handcuffs off her.

- que:
  - why would i do that?
  ans:
  - i want you to put them on.

- que:
  - why would i do such a thing like that?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - robert?
  ans:
  - oh, baby.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - under normal circumstances i'd call the police, but...

- que:
  - am i positive?
  ans:
  - no, molly.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i'm right here.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm not leaving her.

- que:
  - if we can't trust the law, what choice do we have?
  ans:
  - i saved her life.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - it's not like you can snap your fingers and make everything go away.

- que:
  - what's your 20?
  ans:
  - oh my god.

- que:
  - did you kill him?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - feeling any better?
  ans:
  - it hurts to breathe sometimes, but i think i'm just bruised mostly.

- que:

  ans:
  - he won't ever be able to hurt you again.

- que:
  - would you be in danger if you were to go back home?
  ans:
  - no, no, i can't go back.

- que:
  - do you have any family we need to contact, or friends?
  ans:
  - that's not what i meant.

- que:
  - what was that all about?
  ans:
  - it was like you were attacking her.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - i don't understand any of it.

- que:
  - what do we do?
  ans:
  - hide.

- que:
  - who's coming for you?
  ans:
  - just go.

- que:
  - robert graves?
  ans:
  - i have a summons for you.

  ans:
  - business starts and stops when i say.

- que:
  - you may not get the shakes like your old man, but you've... you've hidden a few bottles under the bed, huh?
  ans:
  - you sound like the kind of guy who's got the drop on everyone in reedsville.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - i guess can you can say i've got an eye for the obvious.

- que:
  - all right?
  ans:
  - okay.

- que:
  - did i scare you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - would you like me to stay?
  ans:
  - listen i'm sorry about the parade, son.

- que:
  - speaking of hospitality, who's the nazi at the feed store?
  ans:
  - you must mean t. wallace.

- que:
  - tell you to move your truck?
  ans:
  - he took a picture of my license plate.

- que:
  - why don't we get started?
  ans:
  - our first item here is donated by the reedsville photographic society.

- que:
  - how well do you know the mayor?
  ans:
  - 95.

- que:
  - you ever feel like killing somebody?
  ans:
  - my hair was that long once.

- que:
  - why did you cut it?
  ans:
  - it got in the way.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - um... my daughter, when she was little, she would lie in bed behind me and twist my hair around her finger.

- que:
  - what did she do when you cut it?
  ans:
  - she never knew i did.

- que:
  - did you see what happened?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's him.

- que:
  - who's in the trunk?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - molly, stay out of this.

- que:
  - but who's the other guy, rae?
  ans:
  - cause i don't remember killing him.

- que:
  - oh you want to go?
  ans:
  - out of the sheriff's squad car.

- que:
  - you mean the man you killed... he was carrying this?
  ans:
  - i think he was buying something.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - ask her.

- que:
  - or do you think maybe i should just show her?
  ans:
  - you want to show her more than anything.

- que:
  - is that what's happening?
  ans:
  - i don't want to talk about this...

- que:
  - did t. wallace take these pictures?
  ans:
  - we just want to understand this, rae.

- que:
  - i want to know everything.
  ans:
  - did t. wallace take those pictures?

- que:
  - it's okay.
  ans:
  - who's behind all of this?

- que:
  - this year hasn't been very kind to us, has it, rae?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - robbie...
  ans:
  - what the?

- que:
  - you see, it seems your wife here has a... oh, hell, why say anything when a picture tells a thousand words?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - we some of that\"mess\"you was talking about cleaning up?
  ans:
  - yeah, you caused the mayor a world of trouble, and it's time you two disappeared.

- que:
  - can i talk to you for a minute?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - are we packing up the shed, too?
  ans:
  - we'il talk about that later.

- que:
  - the three of us, huh?
  ans:
  - something my old man told me once keeps popping back into my head.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - he said the two hardest things in this world to catch is a pop fly at a day game, and a young woman when she's lying.

- que:
  - you don't believe her?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you saw the sheriff try to kill her, what do you think?
  ans:
  - i think $200, 000 is a lot of money.

- que:
  - kind of cuts out the middleman with you and me, don't you think?
  ans:
  - it's not ours to take, robert.

- que:
  - you don't know why i took it?
  ans:
  - jesus, there hasn't been a day since ashley died you haven't reminded me that we are broke and life isn't worth living anymore.

- que:
  - do you think if there was a chance, i wouldn't hack off my right arm?
  ans:
  - i'd have done anything.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i want to stop fixing things.

- que:
  - you know what will help me, molly?
  ans:
  - a big black bag.

- que:
  - is that one of your stories?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think it makes a better campfire, though.

- que:
  - where's molly?
  ans:
  - asleep.

- que:
  - in relation to what we got going on in the shed?
  ans:
  - that's what we're talking about here.

- que:
  - money?
  ans:
  - money.

- que:
  - you're just taking the long way around the pond, huh?
  ans:
  - in civil court you just need a preponderance of evidence.

- que:
  - less to prove, right?
  ans:
  - it's easier to convict.

- que:
  - cigarette?
  ans:
  - nah, i'm burning up already.

- que:
  - how can justice prevail?
  ans:
  - you sure sound like you know what you're talking about.

- que:
  - well... this is between us and them, right?
  ans:
  - this is a civil matter.

- que:
  - agreed.
  ans:
  - what about our talk?

- que:
  - see what straight shooting can accomplish?
  ans:
  - you saved my life.

- que:
  - you want to take the money?
  ans:
  - take it.

- que:
  - a kiss from a pretty lady so early in the day.
  ans:
  - well, where were you when i needed you?

- que:
  - is robert with you?
  ans:
  - i think he's out on a walk.

- que:
  - say, would you mind stopping by the library for a bit?
  ans:
  - ruth has a gift for you.

- que:
  - they biting?
  ans:
  - i wasn't fishing.

- que:
  - can we go inside?
  ans:
  - yeah, okay.

  ans:
  - molly.

- que:
  - where is she at the moment?
  ans:
  - she's in town getting groceries.

- que:
  - do you hunt?
  ans:
  - uh... a little bit when i was a kid.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - well, i'm kind of hoping we can catch up with your wife.

- que:
  - you ready?
  ans:
  - i'm ready.

- que:
  - this woman on the swing, who is she?
  ans:
  - if you mean that black and white one... that'd be rae butler.

- que:
  - her husband is a photographer?
  ans:
  - uh, no thanks.

- que:
  - how long you and your wife been staying up at your daddy's cottage?
  ans:
  - we moved in at the beginning of this month.

- que:
  - and this is just for recreational purposes?
  ans:
  - i'm working on a new book.

- que:
  - have you heard anything unusual in the last week?
  ans:
  - no, i haven't.

- que:
  - do you own any other guns other than the shotgun there?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so you're saying you never fired it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - a homicide?
  ans:
  - yes, a multiple homicide.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - that's what i'm trying to figure out here.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - i'm positive.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - well, i didn't mention gunshots.

- que:
  - you know what?
  ans:
  - when you put it that way...

- que:
  - are you sure you don't want a soda or anything?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - say... you ever serve in the army?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i was just wondering.

- que:
  - robert didn't come home last night.
  ans:
  - how could you do that?

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - cops came, took him away.

- que:
  - you're like a little house bird.
  ans:
  - why should i believe you?

- que:
  - you know that, molly?
  ans:
  - without somebody taking care of you or that little house you done built up, you could be squashed in a fist.

- que:
  - why'd you have to beat on him so much?
  ans:
  - he ran.

- que:
  - what's your problem?
  ans:
  - take off the handcuffs.

- que:
  - you mind if i sit?
  ans:
  - now don't be sore at old byron here.

- que:
  - that, uh... remains to be seen, don't you think?
  ans:
  - you're... bleeding there.

- que:
  - why don't you ask him?
  ans:
  - he's the one who took 'em.

- que:
  - you mean t?
  ans:
  - well, now, we've had our differences over the years, but he would never do something like that to me.

- que:
  - then why is he here?
  ans:
  - well, you killed his brother for one.

- que:
  - what is it you want from me?
  ans:
  - mr. graves, we're it.

- que:
  - ain't that right, t?
  ans:
  - like he said, you can be part of\"old reedsville.

- que:
  - so what, you're just gonna kill her?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how do you get all these fools wrapped around your finger?
  ans:
  - i've been hanging out with some of your friends.

- que:
  - where's my money?
  ans:
  - that money buys your life back.

- que:
  - now where is she?
  ans:
  - you like plain talk after all.

- que:
  - robert, can't you see?
  ans:
  - we just wanted to start over.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - i just... just want a new life.

- que:
  - isn't that what you want?
  ans:
  - or maybe you'd like a life with me.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you they'd kill us all?
  ans:
  - i don't understand you.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - then do it.

- que:
  - herman?
  ans:
  - give you peace which surpasses all understanding.

- que:
  - she's been dead for a long time, don't you think?
  ans:

  - yeah?
  ans:
  - well, i have.

- que:
  - what you doing, molly?
  ans:
  - putting one foot in front of the other.

- que:

  ans:
  - it's too bad.

- que:
  - where's that?
  ans:
  - anywhere with you.

- que:
  - are we there yet?
  ans:

  ans:
  - how could you do that?

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - cops came, took him away.

- que:
  - you're like a little house bird.
  ans:
  - why should i believe you?

- que:
  - you know that, molly?
  ans:
  - without somebody taking care of you or that little house you done built up, you could be squashed in a fist.

- que:
  - why'd you have to beat on him so much?
  ans:
  - he ran.

- que:
  - what's your problem?
  ans:
  - take off the handcuffs.

- que:
  - you mind if i sit?
  ans:
  - now don't be sore at old byron here.

  ans:
  - you're... bleeding there.

- que:
  - why don't you ask him?
  ans:
  - he's the one who took 'em.

- que:
  - you mean t?
  ans:
  - well, now, we've had our differences over the years, but he would never do something like that to me.

- que:
  - then why is he here?
  ans:
  - well, you killed his brother for one.

- que:
  - what is it you want from me?
  ans:
  - mr. graves, we're it.

- que:
  - ain't that right, t?

  - we just wanted to start over.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:

  - now, am i pronouncing this right...... mr. ra's al ghul?
  ans:
  - you're not ra's al ghul.

- que:
  - or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, ra's?

  ans:
  - as you wish.

- que:
  - who the hell authorized this?

- que:
  - have you finally learned to do what is necessary?

  ans:
  - batman may have made the front page...... but bruce wayne got pushed to page eight.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - the company went public a week ago.

- que:
  - right, mr. fox?
  ans:
  - right you are, mr. wayne.

  ans:
  - you are in hell, little man.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - for protection.

- que:
  - are you so desperate to fight criminals...... that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?
  ans:
  - actually, there were seven of them.

- que:
  - how do you know my name?
  ans:
  - the world is too small for someone like bruce wayne to disappear...... no matter how deep he chooses to sink.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - my name is merely ducard, but i speak for ra's al ghul...... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

- que:
  - what makes you think i need a path?
  ans:
  - someone like you is only here by choice.

- que:
  - and what path can ra's al ghul offer?
  ans:
  - the path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...... and wishes to serve true justice.

- que:
  - which is?
  ans:
  - legend, mr. wayne.

- que:
  - and what was i looking for?
  ans:
  - only you can know that.

  - ra's al ghul?
  ans:
  - wait.

  - will we be needing an ambulance, master wayne?
  ans:

  - and why do we fall?
  ans:

  - all creatures feel fear.

- que:
  - even the scary ones?

  - you think your mother will like them?
  ans:
  - yeah.

  - what stopped it?
  ans:
  - vengeance.

  ans:
  - i'm not heading back at all.

- que:
  - you don't like it there?
  ans:
  - i like it fine.

- que:
  - why do you give a damn, alfred?
  ans:
  - it's not your family.

- que:
  - should i just bury the past out there with my parents, alfred?
  ans:

  - you don't mean that.
  ans:
  - has he got anything to say?

- que:
  - what if i do, rachel?
  ans:
  - my parents deserved justice.

- que:
  - you care about justice?
  ans:
  - look beyond your own pain, bruce.

- que:
  - you wanna thank him for that?
  ans:
  - here you go.

- que:
  - what chance does gotham have when the good people do nothing?
  ans:
  - i'm not one of your good people, rachel.

- que:
  - what do you mean?

  ans:
  - i couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

- que:
  - dead?
  ans:
  - you've been gone seven years.

- que:
  - you had me declared dead?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:

- que:
  - you know what i think?
  ans:
  - i think your boyfriend shot that little girl and then he ran off.

- que:
  - why won't you listen to her?
  ans:
  - get on your feet.

- que:
  - is that where she was sitting?
  ans:
  - because the angle don't add up for me with the blood on that back window.

- que:
  - i don't have much of an imagination, so i need to get a distinct image of what went down here.
  ans:
  - but... what, are you afraid of a little blood?

- que:
  - what did she do next?
  ans:
  - she... she shot herself.

- que:
  - what do you mean, how?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - didn't she?
  ans:
  - show me how she did it.

- que:
  - and then what did she do?
  ans:
  - she shot herself.

- que:
  - you ain't lying to me again, are you?
  ans:
  - because i have never seen a weapon go off without somebody's finger on the fucking trigger.

- que:
  - you ok?
  ans:
  - morgan, please, please.

- que:
  - just please put the gun down, ok?
  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - get on over to the damn crawford mill.

- que:
  - pepper, i need you to hold that light really steady.
  ans:
  - what do you think he's doing to morgan?

- que:
  - where'd you learn how to do that?
  ans:
  - in juvie.

- que:
  - come on.
  ans:
  - where are we?

- que:
  - why don't you have a seat?
  ans:
  - he's gonna kill you.

- que:
  - didn't you look at his face?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - you ok, child?
  ans:
  - you don't look so good.

- que:
  - she likes me.
  ans:
  - does anybody care about me and my boy?

- que:
  - what's wrong with you fucking people?
  ans:
  - here's your pants.

- que:
  - are you ok?
  ans:
  - here.

- que:
  - where are we going?
  ans:
  - i'm going to get you some help.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - i just want to go home.

- que:
  - you live around here?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what do you want?
  ans:
  - i picked up a girl.

- que:
  - you got it?
  ans:
  - all right.

- que:
  - got it?
  ans:
  - that's ok.

- que:
  - for why?
  ans:
  - for there the priests are very holy.

- que:
  - is it anything interesting, matthew?
  ans:
  - bless you, sir.

- que:
  - what's he want?
  ans:
  - me.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - now.

- que:
  - in hampton court?
  ans:
  - you won't be there by midnight.

- que:
  - what is the man?
  ans:
  - a butcher's son.

- que:
  - what's the man?
  ans:
  - surely, your grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly...... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.

- que:
  - what was that you said, richard?
  ans:
  - nothing, sir thomas, it was out of place.

- que:
  - who is that?
  ans:
  - a young friend from cambridge.

- que:
  - what do they all want?
  ans:
  - a position.

- que:
  - do you recommend him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you recommend me?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what position?
  ans:
  - not now, richard.

- que:
  - why did you oppose me?
  ans:
  - i thought your grace was wrong.

- que:
  - i, your grace?
  ans:
  - spare me your discretion.

- que:
  - more, are you going to help me?
  ans:
  - if your grace will be specific.

- que:
  - what are you going to do about it?
  ans:
  - i'm very sure the king needs no advice from me on what to do about it.

- que:
  - then he needs a son.
  ans:
  - do you favour a change of dynasty?

- que:
  - i repeat, what are you going to do about it?
  ans:
  - i pray for it daily.

- que:
  - are you going to pray for a miracle?
  ans:
  - there are precedents.

- que:
  - have i your support, or have i not?
  ans:
  - the pope gave a dispensation, so that the king might marry...... his brother's widow for state reasons.

- que:
  - we are to ask the pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
  ans:
  - i don't like plodding, thomas.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - then, clearly all we have to do is to approach his holiness and ask him.

- que:
  - by argument?
  ans:
  - argument certainly.

- que:
  - pressure, applied to the church?
  ans:
  - the church has its church property.

- que:
  - is that what you want?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - to govern the country with prayers?
  ans:
  - yes, i should.

- que:
  - suffolk?
  ans:
  - fisher for me.

- que:
  - what about my secretary, master cromwell?
  ans:
  - cromwell.

- que:
  - but?
  ans:
  - goodnight, sir thomas.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - from some grateful poor folk, in leicester.

- que:
  - leicester?
  ans:
  - chelsea.

- que:
  - you've got a licence?
  ans:
  - bless you, yes sir, i've got a licence.

- que:
  - have you been here all night?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you said there was a post?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what post?
  ans:
  - at the new school.

- que:
  - cromwell?
  ans:
  - well, if you know cromwell you don't need my help.

- que:
  - sir thomas?
  ans:
  - if only you knew how much, much rather, i had your help than his.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - look.

- que:
  - thank you.
  ans:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - what will you do with it?
  ans:
  - sell it.

- que:
  - a man should go where he won't be tempted.
  ans:
  - and buy what?

- que:
  - why not be a teacher?
  ans:
  - you'd be a fine teacher.

- que:
  - yes, talking with the cardinal.
  ans:
  - lf i was, who would know it?

- que:
  - it's eating your heart out, isn't it?
  ans:
  - the high affairs of state.

- que:
  - right, sir.
  ans:
  - the divorce?

- que:
  - sir thomas?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - lady alice in bed?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - lady margaret?
  ans:
  - no, sir.

- que:
  - who let him in?
  ans:
  - he's a hard man to keep out, sir.

- que:
  - ls your horse here?
  ans:
  - no, sir, i walked.

- que:
  - may i come again?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - is that final, father?
  ans:
  - as long as he's a heretic, meg, that's absolute.

- que:
  - what did wolsey want?
  ans:
  - nice boy, young will.

- que:
  - was it the divorce?
  ans:
  - to bed.

- que:
  - what did wolsey want?
  ans:
  - will roper's been.

- que:
  - will roper?
  ans:
  - yes, he's been here all night.

- que:
  - have you any message for his majesty?
  ans:
  - if i had served god...... one half so well as i've served my king...... god would not have left me here, to die in this place.

- que:
  - what's he really coming for?
  ans:
  - to talk about the divorce.

- que:
  - can you dance, too?
  ans:
  - yes, your grace.

- que:
  - you're my friend, are you not?
  ans:
  - your majesty.

- que:
  - you know that wolsey named you for chancellor?
  ans:
  - before he died, wolsey named you, and wolsey was no fool.

- que:
  - then, why did he fail me?
  ans:
  - it was villainy then.

- que:
  - because i'm simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
  ans:
  - what is it?

- que:
  - because of that i say, do they take me for a simpleton?
  ans:
  - wolsey was a proud man, thomas.

- que:
  - have you thought of it since we last spoke?
  ans:
  - of little else.

- que:
  - that you should put away queen catherine, sire?
  ans:
  - everyone else does.

- que:
  - then, why does your grace need my poor support?
  ans:
  - because you're honest.

- que:
  - how'd you like our music?
  ans:
  - that air they played, it had a certain....

- que:
  - then i will tell my true opinion.
  ans:
  - could it have been your grace's own?

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - i hardly know myself.

- que:
  - what's that?
  ans:
  - eight o'clock, your grace.

- que:
  - shall we eat?
  ans:
  - if your grace pleases.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - thomas?
  ans:
  - stay friends with him.

- que:
  - have l?
  ans:
  - so meg tells me.

- que:
  - sir thomas.
  ans:
  - if it's true, is it a matter for congratulation?

- que:
  - richard?
  ans:
  - i fell.

- que:
  - do you know william roper, the younger?
  ans:
  - by reputation, of course.

- que:
  - you've heard of me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - in what connection?
  ans:
  - i don't know what you can have heard.

- que:
  - have you done something to make you not welcome?
  ans:
  - cromwell is asking questions.

- que:
  - of whom?
  ans:
  - of him, for one.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - and when the last law was down, and the devil turned on you...... where would you hide, roper, the laws all being flat?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - master rich?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - rich?
  ans:
  - come in.

- que:
  - have i kept you waiting?
  ans:
  - months.

- que:
  - what news?
  ans:
  - sir thomas paget is retiring.

- que:
  - tis surprising, isn't it?
  ans:
  - i mean, one sees that's logical.

- que:
  - what kind of thing would you repeat or report?
  ans:
  - nothing said in friendship.

- que:
  - do you believe that?
  ans:
  - why, yes.

- que:
  - is it in your gift?
  ans:
  - effectively.

- que:
  - what must i do for it?
  ans:
  - i know a man who wants to change his woman.

- que:
  - have you only just noticed?
  ans:
  - your friend, our present lord chancellor, now there's an innocent man.

- que:
  - lnconvenience?
  ans:
  - just so.

- que:
  - this goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
  ans:
  - come along, he gave you a silver goblet.

- que:
  - how much did you get for it?
  ans:
  - fifty shillings.

- que:
  - it was a gift, wasn't it, from a litigant, a woman?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - which court was the litigant's case?
  ans:
  - court of requests.

- que:
  - that wasn't too painful, was it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - yea or nay?
  ans:
  - his majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.

- que:
  - alice?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - shall i, sir?
  ans:
  - no, thank you, son roper.

- que:
  - margaret...... will you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - have i your word that what we say here is between us two?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - and if the king should command you to repeat what i may say?
  ans:
  - i should keep my word to you.

- que:
  - we are at war with the pope.
  ans:
  - then what has become of your oath of obedience to the king?

- que:
  - for the pope's a prince, isn't he?
  ans:
  - he is.

- que:
  - and will you forfeit all you have...... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
  ans:
  - because what matters is that i believe it, or rather, no...... not that i believe it, but that i believe it.

- que:
  - i trust i make myself obscure?
  ans:
  - perfectly.

- que:
  - why do you insult me with this lawyer's chatter?
  ans:
  - because i'm afraid.

- que:
  - what side is that?
  ans:
  - well, sir, we all know what you think.

- que:
  - will you stay?
  ans:
  - well, sir, that's according.

- que:
  - why should you?
  ans:
  - no, sir thomas, i will not.

- que:
  - sit by the fire...... and make goslings in the ash?
  ans:
  - not at all, alice.

- que:
  - this english church will divorce him from the queen, then marry him to lady anne.
  ans:
  - alice, shall i teach you to read?

- que:
  - but on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - on peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - would i tell meg what i won't tell you?
  ans:
  - meg has your heart.

- que:
  - but he's silent, master secretary, why not leave him silent?
  ans:
  - your grace, not being a man of letters...... you perhaps don't realise the extent of his reputation.

- que:
  - what kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
  ans:
  - i have evidence that sir thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

- que:
  - when was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years...... totalled 100 and a gold chain?
  ans:
  - it is, as you imply, common practice...... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.

- que:
  - did sir thomas accept this cup?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - he gave it to me, your grace.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - a gift.

- que:
  - when did thomas give you this thing?
  ans:
  - i can't exactly remember.

- que:
  - do you\"remember\"what you did with it?
  ans:
  - i sold it.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - a shop.

- que:
  - has the shop still got it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you doubt master rich's word, your grace?
  ans:
  - it had occurred to me.

- que:
  - what's that you say?
  ans:
  - the king particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of sir thomas.

- que:
  - indeed?
  ans:
  - he told me.

- que:
  - look here, cromwell...... what's the purpose of all this?
  ans:
  - there you have me.

- que:
  - cromwell, are you threatening me?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the charges?
  ans:
  - i understand there are certain charges.

- que:
  - make a note of that, will you, master rich?
  ans:
  - there are no charges.

- que:
  - you have heard of the so called\"holy maid of kent\"...... who was executed for prophesying against the king?
  ans:
  - yes, i met her.

- que:
  - how was that?
  ans:
  - she spoke no treason.

- que:
  - do you expect me to believe that?
  ans:
  - happily, there were witnesses.

- que:
  - by the bishop of rome, or do you insist on\"pope\"?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - for example, in the church of england...... what exactly is the bishop of rome's authority?
  ans:
  - you will find it very ably set out and defended, master secretary...... in the king's book.

- que:
  - do you deny you instigated it?
  ans:
  - it was from first to last the king's own project.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.

- que:
  - have you anything to say...... regarding the king's marriage with queen anne?
  ans:
  - i understood i was not to be asked that again.

- que:
  - brought?
  ans:
  - you've brought yourself to where you stand now.

- que:
  - what will you do now?
  ans:
  - whatever's necessary.

- que:
  - i followed you.
  ans:
  - do you blame them?

- que:
  - i wish i wasn't, but i am.
  ans:
  - were you followed?

- que:
  - what's to be done then?
  ans:
  - give in.

- que:
  - we're supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we've all given in.
  ans:
  - and who are you?

- que:
  - we'il end our friendship now.
  ans:
  - why must you stand out?

- que:
  - for friendship's sake?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - gripping, is it not?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - it's their nature?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - it's why you breed them?
  ans:
  - it's so with men.

- que:
  - and we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
  ans:
  - is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite...... of norfolk's, but is just norfolk?

- que:
  - i couldn't get a boat.
  ans:
  - father?

- que:
  - what is it, meg?
  ans:
  - father, there's a new act going through parliament.

- que:
  - on what compulsion is the oath?
  ans:
  - high treason.

- que:
  - do the words matter?
  ans:
  - we know what it means.

- que:
  - take it?
  ans:
  - and if it can be taken, you must take it, too.

- que:
  - where to this time?
  ans:
  - richmond palace.

- que:
  - have you anything to say?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - seen this document before?
  ans:
  - many times.

- que:
  - will you swear to it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - will you swear to it?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - then why won't he swear to the act?
  ans:
  - because there is more than that in the act.

- que:
  - if you're willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
  ans:
  - is that what you deny?

- que:
  - i don't know if the marriage was lawful or not...... but damn it, thomas, look at these names.
  ans:
  - then you do have objections to the act?

- que:
  - so, those of us whose names are there, are damned, sir thomas?
  ans:
  - i have no window to look into another man's conscience.

- que:
  - then the matter is capable of question?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - and if it is round, will the king's command flatten it?
  ans:
  - no, i will not sign.

- que:
  - then you have more regard for your own doubt than the king's command?
  ans:
  - for myself i have no doubt.

- que:
  - no doubt of what?
  ans:
  - no doubt that i will not take this oath.

- que:
  - then i am not threatened.
  ans:
  - how should i threaten?

- que:
  - gentlemen, can't i go to bed?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - why, you have books?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - may i see my family?
  ans:
  - have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the king's divorce, supremacy...

- que:
  - ... or the king's marriage?
  ans:
  - no, not a word.

- que:
  - secretary?
  ans:
  - tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner's books.

- que:
  - is that necessary?
  ans:
  - with regards to this case, the king is becoming impatient.

- que:
  - for god's sake, they haven't put you in here?
  ans:
  - no, sir, a visit.

- que:
  - is this why they've let you come?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - how do you plan to do that?
  ans:
  - father.

- que:
  - what is an oath then, but words we say to god?
  ans:
  - well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.

- que:
  - content?
  ans:
  - if they'd open a crack that wide, i'd be through it like a bird and back to chelsea.

- que:
  - and leave you?
  ans:
  - it makes no difference.

- que:
  - will?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - margaret?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - you still make a superlative custard, alice.
  ans:
  - alice?

- que:
  - do l?
  ans:
  - that's a nice dress you have on.

- que:
  - master secretary cromwell, have you the charge?
  ans:
  - i have, my lord.

- que:
  - was this no denial?
  ans:
  - no, this was silence.

- que:
  - why have i been called again?
  ans:
  - then i'il keep a good grip on it.

- que:
  - so, sir thomas...... you stand on your silence?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - what do we hear?
  ans:
  - silence.

- que:
  - what does it betoken, this silence?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - if, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened...... you must construe that i consented, not that i denied.
  ans:
  - is there a man in this country...... who does not know sir thomas more's opinion of this title?

- que:
  - do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
  ans:
  - the world must construe according to its wits.

- que:
  - now rich, on may 12, you were at the tower?
  ans:
  - i was.

- que:
  - for what purpose?
  ans:
  - i was sent to carry away the prisoner's books.

- que:
  - did you talk with the prisoner?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - did you talk of the king's supremacy of the church?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what did you say?
  ans:
  - i said to him, \"supposing there were an act of parliament...

- que:
  - would not you, master more, take me for king?
  ans:
  - that i would, \"he said.

- que:

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - walking.

- que:
  - what makes you think that?
  ans:
  - that's no answer.

- que:
  - no one really cares, do they?
  ans:
  - his friends didn't really like him.

- que:
  - what was in it for you?
  ans:
  - nothing for me.

- que:
  - you expect me to believe you?
  ans:
  - but before you even think about doing that, you gotta towel down.

- que:
  - put the razor in cold water, not hot, because metal does what in cold?
  ans:
  - i don't know, johnny.

- que:
  - ain't it the life though?
  ans:
  - hello, sal.

- que:
  - you sure?
  ans:

  ans:
  - yeah, they'il be fine.

- que:
  - or didn t you care?
  ans:
  - i figured you'd come early looking for blood.

- que:
  - but if you knew i d come to kill you, how do you know i won't still?
  ans:
  - there s nothing init for you now.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - pin this on the dane.

- que:
  - why did mink shoot rug anyway?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - so you re gonna say the dane did this?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - funny, ain't it?
  ans:
  - mink was terrified the dane'd find out me and him were jungle dup together.

- que:
  - scratch, huh?
  ans:
  - a little bonus.

- que:
  - why did mink take rug's hair?
  ans:
  - beats me.

- que:
  - fifty fifty on the dough?
  ans:
  - or maybe i should get more, since i did the deed.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because the dane's already dead halfway across town.

- que:
  - what the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - eddie dane is dead.

- que:
  - what the hell are you talking about?
  ans:
  - you took my gun.

- que:
  - are you crazy?
  ans:
  - we're square.

- que:
  - so what's in it for you?
  ans:
  - there's no angle.

- que:
  - tad?
  ans:
  - it's tom.

- que:
  - a little hooch, whatever?
  ans:
  - thanks for coming, tom.

- que:
  - who's he got in there?
  ans:
  - o'doole and the mayor.

- que:
  - i guess, uh huh?
  ans:
  - she's taking the car.

- que:
  - hell, tom, why didn t you tell me what you were up to?
  ans:
  - i thought you d really gone over.

- que:
  - do you always know why you do things, leo?
  ans:
  - sure i do.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - i know, can you believe that?
  ans:
  - we could always test you a third time, rodney.

- que:
  - what am i supposed to do?
  ans:
  - he s afraid of the thing.

- que:
  - what are you saying, dr. jackson?
  ans:
  - it s an 8 symbol address.

- que:
  - you like it here?
  ans:
  - yes sir.

- que:
  - like what?
  ans:
  - now s good.

- que:
  - wasn t me.
  ans:
  - sir, what the hell was that?

- que:
  - keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky?
  ans:
  - the exceptional flying of major john sheppard.

- que:
  - what say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?
  ans:
  - ah, weir s in here.

- que:
  - in their  flying city?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - flying city?
  ans:
  - well, uh, keep in mind this is the race that built the stargates  they did everything big.

- que:
  - um  who knows?
  ans:
  - we know the ancients on earth were suffering from a plague.

- que:
  - but isn t that reason enough to go?
  ans:
  - well i ve been choosing members for this expedition for months, dr.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the z. p. m. he s, uh, he s canadian.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - you re the one who fired that thing at me.

- que:
  - you mean the drone?
  ans:
  - the weapon the ancients built to defend this outpost.

- que:
  - you do have security clearance to be here?
  ans:
  - yeah, yeah, general o neill just gave it to me.

- que:
  - the what?
  ans:
  - jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous amount of power.

- que:
  - you think there are more of these zed things in atlantis?
  ans:
  - i said don t touch anything.

- que:
  - did i do that?
  ans:
  - we could be on our way to discovering an entirely new ancient civilization.

- que:
  - oh, don t you have a dozen or so people already who can use the ancient technology?
  ans:
  - yeah, with concentration and training they can make it work.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - this isn t a long trip so i il be as succinct as possible.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - with all due respect, sir, we were just attacked by an alien missile.

- que:
  - why d you become a pilot?
  ans:
  - i think people that don t wanna fly are crazy.

- que:
  - does anyone else here speak the language these guy's are speaking?
  ans:
  - i just need a couple of minutes to finish my work, and you're not helping by standing there.

- que:
  - we there yet?
  ans:
  - we re just waiting on dr. mckay.

- que:
  - can i have everyone s attention please?
  ans:
  - all right, here we go.

- que:
  - that would be dr. weir, right?
  ans:
  - chevron three encoded.

- que:
  - what is it we re looking at?
  ans:
  - switching to zero locks.

- que:
  - it s structurally in tact?
  ans:
  - the climactic sensors say there s oxygen, no measurable toxins ; we have viable life support.

- que:
  - what does it feel like?
  ans:
  - hurts like hell, sir.

- que:
  - security teams, any alien contact?
  ans:
  - negative, sir.

- que:
  - can you come down and meet me please?
  ans:
  - we re three levels down, come in.

- que:
  - so it might really be the lost city of atlantis?
  ans:
  - not much. could travel between the stars, exchanging knowledge and friendship.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - that if we don t stop everything we re doing right now, we are dead.

- que:
  - what if it fails completely?
  ans:
  - it s a matter of when, not if.

- que:
  - all right, well how much time do we have?
  ans:
  - it s hard to say.

- que:
  - what about our own power generators?
  ans:
  - we re working on that, but with our most advanced naquada power generators, the equations are coming up far short.

- que:
  - well how do we do that if we can t search the city?
  ans:
  - if there were more here, we d be able to detect them.

- que:
  - can we use the stargate?
  ans:
  - there s nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to earth.

- que:
  - everything okay here, sheppard?
  ans:
  - yes, sir, just a couple of kids.

- que:
  - are you here to trade?
  ans:
  - trade, yes.

- que:
  - now how many times have i told you not to play in the forest after dark?
  ans:
  - i m just glad you re safe.

- que:
  - what was that mask you had on?
  ans:
  - helps you see in the dark, check it out.

- que:
  - this?
  ans:
  - the wraith.

- que:
  - can we go there?
  ans:
  - afraid not, i come from a galaxy far, far away.

- que:
  - is that a fact?
  ans:
  - well then, we il just uh, we il have to get to know each other.

- que:
  - will you join us?
  ans:
  - i love a good cup of tea.

- que:
  - who are these wraith?
  ans:
  - we have never met anyone who did not know.

- que:
  - what if the wraith are the enemy the ancient hologram lady is talking about?
  ans:
  - all the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we need to abandon atlantis.

- que:
  - do i?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - then there is something you should see.
  ans:
  - you truly cannot return to your world?

- que:
  - how much further is this place?
  ans:
  - not far.

- que:
  - what s this?
  ans:
  - i lost this years ago.

- que:
  - someone s been busy, huh?
  ans:
  - the drawings in the caves are extensive.

- que:
  - does this represent the destruction of your city?
  ans:
  - this drawing far predates that.

- que:
  - someone knew it was gonna happen?
  ans:
  - i believe it happens again, and again.

- que:
  - where the hell is he?
  ans:
  - they are not really there.

- que:
  - what am i looking for?
  ans:
  - there  another part of the force field just failed.

- que:
  - the city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
  ans:
  - how are we doing?

- que:
  - to save it for whom?
  ans:
  - survivors from the settlement ; we were attacked.

- que:
  - what s going on?
  ans:
  - we are in no position to help anyone right now.

- que:
  - what the hell s going on here?
  ans:
  - we were about to abandon the city.

- que:
  - jinto, you have any other address where we can gate to?
  ans:
  - yes, many.

- que:
  - so now could our naquada generators supply enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?
  ans:
  - not even close.

- que:
  - all right, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, all right?
  ans:
  - come on, what do we know about the wraith.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don t need to answer your question  because the people in charge didn t consider the ramifications before they reacted.

- que:
  - how am i supposed to react?
  ans:
  - and we re defenseless, you said so yourself.

- que:
  - how do you know going off on some half assed rescue mission isn t going to bring them all right back here to our doorstep?
  ans:
  - maybe it will, but it s the right thing to do.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because it is.

- que:
  - do you know what that means?
  ans:
  - it s just a matter of time before the wraith figure out that this is the base of our operations.

- que:
  - we weren t there for more than a few hours before they showed up.
  ans:
  - i mean who knows?

- que:
  - and that one of these people you brought back here with you tipped them off?
  ans:
  - it s possible.

- que:
  - any idea what to expect?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how do i know he s not the one who told them?
  ans:
  - someone comes.

- que:
  - we re the ones you re after, right?
  ans:
  - i m their leader.

- que:
  - wait, what was that?
  ans:
  - rotate the camera.

- que:
  - you re sure this is the right address?
  ans:
  - it s the only one we could get a lock on.

- que:
  - dr. beckett, what was it you wanted me to see?
  ans:
  - these cells have none of the normal human inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

- que:
  - i say that anything he saw was caused by a residual command language in the severed nerve endings.
  ans:
  - what about the movement major sheppard saw?

- que:
  - very, very old.
  ans:
  - all right, anything else?

- que:
  - i don t blame ya.
  ans:
  - how old?

- que:
  - what is that noise?
  ans:
  - i...

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - i have no idea.

- que:
  - a little puddle jumper like this?
  ans:
  - it s a ship, it goes through the gate.

- que:
  - i thought we were going with gate ship?
  ans:
  - negative, flight.

- que:
  - did you do that?
  ans:
  - i was just wondering where we go from here.

- que:
  - so how do we find them once we land?
  ans:
  - well i ve been thinking about that too.

- que:
  - is my son alive?
  ans:
  - he s well and waiting for you.

- que:
  - where s colonel sumner?
  ans:
  - he was taken by the wraith.

- que:
  - how about when?
  ans:
  - not long.

- que:
  - how  bout a diversion a little bit?
  ans:
  - we re gonna need to make some noise out there.

- que:
  - rig up the c4 to blow a hole and get these people out of here on my signal, all right?
  ans:
  - i can find the colonel with this, there aren t that many wraith around.

- que:
  - what do you call yourself?
  ans:
  - colonel marshall sumner, united states marine corps.

- que:
  - is it valor or ignorance?
  ans:
  - we traveled through the stargate as peaceful explorers.

- que:
  - feeding ground?
  ans:
  - all living things must eat.

- que:
  - why do you care?
  ans:
  - hunger  is distasteful.

- que:
  - what do you call your world?
  ans:
  - earth.

- que:
  - more?
  ans:
  - our feeding ground has not been so rich in ten thousand years.

- que:
  - is that the kind of treatment i can expect for myself and my people?
  ans:
  - as i have said, all living things must eat.

- que:
  - where is this new feeding ground?
  ans:
  - i won t...

- que:
  - how s the hand feeling?
  ans:
  - much better.

- que:
  - how did this come to you?
  ans:
  - i don t remember.

- que:
  - how d you find me?
  ans:
  - tread marks, standard issue.

- que:
  - how many are left?
  ans:
  - sir, we need to leave.

- que:
  - colonel sumner?
  ans:
  - we are well enough.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - we re safe as long as they can t see us.

- que:
  - then how can we get through?
  ans:
  - we have to draw them away from the gate and double back.

- que:
  - you see anything like a weapons console over there?
  ans:
  - try and go invisible again.

- que:
  - do we have an identification code?
  ans:
  - nothing yet.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - look around you.

- que:
  - how come i never make friends like that?
  ans:
  - you need to get out more.

- que:
  - is there lemon in this?
  ans:
  - one more thing major.

- que:
  - well you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be reminded of that?
  ans:
  - we need to get back out there ; do what we came to do.

- que:
  - is there a possibility... that all potentials exist side by side?
  ans:
  - have you ever seen yourself through the eyes of someone else that you have become...

- que:
  - what is reality?
  ans:
  - i think the more you look at quantum physics... the more mysterious and wondrous it becomes.

- que:
  - have you ever thought about what thoughts are made of?
  ans:
  - every age, every generation has its built in assumptions

- que:
  - is everyone an enigma?
  ans:
  - they most certainly are.

- que:
  - isn't it amazing that we have options and potentials that exist... but we're unaware of them?
  ans:
  - we've been conditioned to believe... that the external world is more real than the internal world.

- que:
  - what is reality?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did you know that the brain imprints what it has the ability to see?
  ans:
  - this is important.

- que:
  - so is it possible our eyes, our cameras... see more than what our brain... has the ability to consciously project?
  ans:
  - well, the way our brain is wired up... we only see what we believe is possible.

- que:
  - you okay?
  ans:
  - i heard you scream earlier.

- que:
  - was it another dream?
  ans:
  - you were an indian... watching columbus's ship materialize out of thin air.

- que:
  - my pills are fine, okay?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - so where do they go when they're not here?
  ans:
  - now, that question is tricky.

- que:
  - they say, \"where do they go?
  ans:
  - there's a great mystery called the mystery of the direction of time.

- que:
  - wanna shoot some hoops?
  ans:
  - now, you don't have to be like that.

- que:
  - how long has it been since you played?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - how long has it been?
  ans:
  - i'il be late.

- que:
  - what's the matter?
  ans:
  - remember, it's empty.

- que:
  - how do you know this shit?
  ans:
  - i read dr. quantum comics.

- que:
  - the question is, how far down the rabbit hole do you wanna go?
  ans:
  - nice shot.

- que:
  - how can a system or an object be in two or more states at the same time?
  ans:
  - it's very easy instead of thinking of things as things.

- que:
  - what's the big deal?
  ans:
  - you say, \"look right in the chamber.

- que:
  - and yet, there's this completely amazing magic... sitting right in front of your eyes.
  ans:
  - oh, well, what does that really mean?

- que:
  - is this then the observer?
  ans:
  - in my modeling, the observer is the spirit... inside the four layer biobodysuit.

- que:
  - there's no photographer.
  ans:
  - where the hell are you?

- que:
  - or a hot date?
  ans:
  - well, the chief of police went on television saying that...

- que:
  - this leads naturally to wonder do people are people affecting the world of reality that they see?
  ans:
  - you betcha they are.

- que:
  - but hurry, will ya, please?
  ans:
  - because these models are giving me a headache.

- que:
  - makes you wonder, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - if you accept with every rudiment of your being... that you will walk on water, will it happen?
  ans:
  - yes, it will.

- que:
  - you see how we are extending the image of ourselves?
  ans:
  - sucked.

- que:
  - me?
  ans:
  - the day i make someone sane, they're in trouble.

- que:
  - it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - is there a substance of thought?
  ans:
  - i guess itjust depends on what you think is real.

- que:
  - guilty.
  ans:
  - are all realities in the quantum field existing simultaneously?

- que:
  - this is a good assignment, if you'd see it that way.
  ans:
  - a wedding?

- que:
  - what's to see?
  ans:
  - i do. \"they did.

- que:
  - i took the pictures, remember?
  ans:

- que:
  - you mean the priests?
  ans:
  - come on.

- que:
  - how can any one little carbon unit... on earth in the backwaters of... indeed, the milky way, the boondocks... betray god almighty?
  ans:
  - that is impossible.

- que:
  - who is in the driver's seat when we control our emotions or we respond to our emotions?
  ans:
  - we know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together wire together.

- que:
  - does that mean emotions are good or emotions are bad?
  ans:
  - no, emotions are designed so that it reinforces chemically... something into long term memory.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - mixed.

- que:
  - got any tips?
  ans:
  - you won't do anything, so i will.

- que:
  - what are you standing there for?
  ans:
  - get out and serve.

- que:
  - so how can anyone really say they're in love with a specific person... for example?
  ans:
  - they're only in love with the anticipation... of the emotions they're addicted to.

- que:
  - my goodness, doesn't that change the landscape... of our emotional outlook on personal needs and identities?
  ans:
  - oh, yeah.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - polacks they all look the same in a tux.

- que:
  - so, what's your name?
  ans:
  - hello.

- que:
  - what do we need?
  ans:
  - some foxes.

- que:
  - hello there, big boy.
  ans:
  - now... what about people who are addicted to sex?

- que:
  - i want to hear some  hold on.
  ans:
  - is there a rocket in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?

- que:
  - would you not touch anything?
  ans:
  - that's very expensive equipment.

- que:
  - i want to hear some polka music, okay?
  ans:
  - these people want to hear some polka music.

- que:
  - what happens when we age?
  ans:
  - our skin gets loses elasticity.

- que:
  - what happens to our enzymes?
  ans:
  - we don't digest as well.

- que:
  - what happens to our synovial fluid?
  ans:
  - those are proteins that become brittle and stiff.

- que:
  - what happens to our bones?
  ans:
  - they become thin.

- que:
  - so then the question arises... does it really matter what we eat?
  ans:
  - if thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.

- que:
  - why do you have addictions?
  ans:
  - because you have nothing better.

- que:
  - do i think that you are bad?
  ans:
  - i don't think you're bad.

  ans:
  - they were only fiction.

- que:
  - now, where do you go from here?
  ans:

  ans:
  - no, i won't.

- que:

- que:
  - what trouble can they get into?
  ans:
  - if you don't understand, i'm not going to explain.

- que:

  ans:
  - betty, i'm old enough, but he's a tough man to handle.

- que:
  - yeah, but how?
  ans:
  - i have a selfish idea.

- que:
  - wouldn't that just bowl him over?
  ans:
  - i'm sure it would.

- que:
  - what good is life if i know i didn't have the guts to live it my way?
  ans:
  - rodney.

  - the biggest lie you ever heard.

- que:
  - was it true?
  ans:
  - it was all true.

- que:
  - do you claim your sister killed your stepfather because he grabbed her?
  ans:
  - he was a strong man, and we were both afraid.

  ans:
  - she was madder than he was, and scareder.

- que:
  - did she sneak up behind him and hit him...... with that firewood when he wasn't looking?

  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you know what he did during that year and a half?
  ans:
  - he was in the navy, he said.

- que:
  - do you imply that he came home from the war...... from combat duty, just to beat you up?
  ans:
  - we object, your honor.

- que:
  - did your stepfather own the house you live in?
  ans:
  - well, my brother and i, we fixed it up.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i wanted to.

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how could you tell?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - would you say the arguments in the cross household...... were more or less violent than any other family's?
  ans:
  - objection.

- que:
  - what's the purpose of that question?
  ans:
  - the witness must define her terms, if the jury is to clearly understand her.

- que:
  - did your daughter ever tell you she'd seen lucas beat selena?
  ans:

- que:

  - you don't suppose they're trying to walk to san lorenzo?
  ans:
  - 511.

- que:

  ans:
  - yep.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:

  ans:
  - we only found sergeant vega and the baby.

- que:

  - we wish we knew too.

- que:
  - then this isn't the first time?
  ans:
  - the first sunday after the eruption...... various of the congregation were not in church.

- que:
  - father, what about that story about the demon bull?
  ans:
  - that seems like a strange superstition.

- que:
  - has miraflores been attacked also?
  ans:
  - cattle had been found dead in various areas of the ranch.

- que:
  - shall we try around over that side, or over here?
  ans:
  - neither one of them looks exactly like a pan american highway.

- que:
  - you see a trail up around those rocks?
  ans:
  - i don't know about that, but i've found something a lot more interesting.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - s, s, seor.

- que:
  - gently, now.
  ans:
  - horse?

- que:
  - no sharp pains?

- que:
  - do you happen to have a canteen?
  ans:
  - oh, sure.

- que:

  ans:
  - i'il say it is.

- que:
  - could i ask another favor of you?
  ans:
  - well, sure.

- que:
  - would you mind taking me back to san lorenzo?
  ans:
  - be glad to.

- que:
  - how are things in san lorenzo?
  ans:
  - oh, so so.

- que:
  - is that any reason to act like frightened children?
  ans:
  - i don't think it's just a poisonous plant, seorita.

- que:
  - then we'il meet later?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - if your patron, my father, were alive today...... would you be frightened of sounds in the night and run like children to the village?
  ans:
  - seorita teresa, i understand you need us.

- que:
  - where is he?
  ans:
  - in the laboratory with dr. delacruz.

- que:
  - laboratory?
  ans:
  - you'd be surprised at the experiments that go on there.

- que:
  - where is it?
  ans:
  - this way.

- que:
  - doctor, is that the patrolman?
  ans:
  - yes, sergeant vega...... who lived doing his duty and who may perform a greater one now.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - looked like subcutaneous cells that had just burst or run rampant.

- que:
  - you think it is a poison, then?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - not a chemical poison, doctor?
  ans:
  - no, but i believe for many reasons that this is an organic poison.

- que:
  - who doesn't, doctor?
  ans:
  - well, as you say, if it's an organic poison...... anything from nature, the great velasco will identify it.

- que:
  - what other reasons?
  ans:
  - well, there was only one wound.

- que:
  - footprints?
  ans:
  - you are amazed.

- que:
  - well, the alcohol, the distilled water, the salt solution, i can understand that...... but what's the tequila for?
  ans:
  - well, in your country, i believe you call it a coffee break.

- que:
  - why put on such a face?
  ans:
  - we will do it if i have to stay in the saddle without sleep myself.

- que:
  - pio, don't you understand?
  ans:
  - can't you see the cattle know that something evil is carried in the wind.

- que:
  - would you like some brandy, sir?
  ans:
  - yes, thank you.

- que:
  - would you like some too?
  ans:
  - please.

- que:
  - may i make a complaint, teresa?
  ans:
  - oh, i'm sorry.

- que:
  - what was not done suitably?
  ans:
  - well, that's just it.

- que:
  - well, is that so bad?
  ans:
  - that all depends.

- que:
  - see anything?
  ans:
  - hold it up against the light.

- que:
  - do you like to keep scorpions?
  ans:
  - i know a place where there are millions.

- que:
  - why don't we?
  ans:
  - oh, excuse me, the line's been fixed.

- que:
  - hacienda miraflores?
  ans:
  - just testing the line.

- que:
  - oh, is the line all fixed?
  ans:

  ans:
  - keep quiet.

- que:
  - what's wrong with the cattle, pio?
  ans:
  - i cannot say.

- que:
  - where is juanito?
  ans:
  - he's safe.

- que:
  - where is the laboratory?
  ans:
  - it's over there.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - i emptied the machine gun at one of them.

- que:
  - what weapon do you intend to use?
  ans:
  - gas.

- que:
  - is that all of them, lieutenant?
  ans:
  - i want to do what i can too.

- que:
  - see if you can find my boots for me, will you?
  ans:
  - i know where they are.

- que:
  - you kind of like those, huh?
  ans:
  - tell you what, juanito...... when you get to be a big man, i'il get you a pair just like these.

- que:
  - you like that, huh?
  ans:
  - i know how to ride very good.

- que:
  - a half a man\"?
  ans:
  - oh, juanito, you know sometimes even a half a man...... has a lot of different jobs to do.

- que:
  - you be very careful and don't get hurt, won't you?
  ans:
  - don't worry, i promise.

- que:
  - how deep do you say it is?
  ans:
  - doc and i have been down many a cave...... but there's no way of really telling until you actually hit bottom.

- que:
  - what do you say, doc?
  ans:
  - right.

- que:
  - will that poisonous gas work in a crevice this big?
  ans:
  - i could not anticipate such a void as this.

- que:
  - you want my men to go down there?
  ans:
  - it's suicide.

- que:
  - what are you doing here?
  ans:
  - i'm a stowaway.

- que:
  - juanito, do me a favor, will you, and just stay out of the way?
  ans:
  - yes, mr. hank.

- que:
  - and just sit in the jeep like a big boy, okay?
  ans:
  - put these in the cage.

- que:
  - why the birds, professor?
  ans:
  - if the birds stop singing, that means there's poison gas in the cave.

- que:
  - whose responsibility is it?
  ans:
  - the police, the army, the people who live here.

- que:
  - why did you do that?
  ans:
  - maybe i just wanted to see what you'd do.

- que:
  - what did i do?
  ans:
  - you did all right.

- que:
  - hank, are you all right?
  ans:
  - it's the head of a scorpion in the wall.

- que:
  - can you see any signs of mendoza?
  ans:
  - no, not from here.

- que:
  - are you there, hank?
  ans:
  - hank, answer.

  - what happened to hank?
  ans:
  - hank and juanito are down there.

- que:
  - oh, juanito, why did you do it?
  ans:
  - i tried to help them.

- que:
  - you couldn't use the gas?
  ans:
  - no, we lost it in the molten lava.

- que:
  - can't we close and seal that opening with dynamite?
  ans:
  - you have no idea as to the size of that place.

- que:
  - but suppose they find another way?
  ans:
  - those passages down there.

- que:
  - ready?
  ans:
  - let her go.

- que:
  - you'il be in mexico city for a week first?
  ans:

- que:
  - oh, but even if we do have, what, a day, two days...?
  ans:
  - i don't want to settle for just two days, hank.

- que:
  - how are you, sir?
  ans:
  - well, we're just getting started, finally.

- que:
  - everything is under control, isn't it?
  ans:
  - there's no cause for alarm, not at all.

- que:
  - oh, a plane?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure, that would help a lot.

- que:
  - oh, dr. velasco, do you suppose there'd be room for three on that plane?
  ans:
  - of course there will.

- que:
  - did he suspect?
  ans:
  - no, i don't think so.

- que:
  - what have you got against marriage?
  ans:
  - i try to remember what my father told me one time.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - i am victor esteban.

- que:
  - but what about seorita alvarez?
  ans:
  - i have orders to take her wherever she wishes.

- que:
  - now you're convinced our fears are justified?
  ans:
  - this scorpion may be one that...

- que:
  - exactly where is this area where it was photographed?
  ans:
  - southwest of the volcano.

- que:
  - what is that long arm there?
  ans:
  - that is a cavern which extends southward to within 20 miles of mexico city...... there, where it lies under the railroad.

- que:
  - and when will they decide to come to the surface after blood?
  ans:
  - so that is why we brought you here.

- que:
  - how powerful?
  ans:
  - the throat.

- que:
  - can you duplicate the poison?
  ans:
  - nope.

  - hank, what's the meeting on friday about?
  ans:
  - oh, some geophysical conference dr. velasco roped us in on.

- que:
  - after you finish that, where am i taking you for dinner?
  ans:
  - hank, it's only 9:00.

- que:
  - do you realize this is mexico city?
  ans:
  - and no one has dinner before 11:00 at night.

- que:
  - aren't you overdoing it a bit, hank?
  ans:
  - well, i've gotta make an impression on you in 48 hours that'il last for two months.

- que:
  - don't you like caviar?
  ans:
  - oh, i love it, but i must say i could never understand why it's so expensive.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - you can help us soon enough.

- que:
  - where is the scorpion?
  ans:
  - we lost it in the hills 10 miles out of town.

- que:
  - with what kind of weapon?
  ans:
  - i hope it is a weapon.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:

  - i guess i could call a taxi...

- que:
  - so you want a traditional thai buddhist service?
  ans:
  - if that's a problem, we can go somewhere else.

- que:
  - i assume the deceased will remain at the temple for three days... before we have the service here?
  ans:
  - the buddha, the altar, the carpet kneelers.

- que:
  - but how do we know you're safe here?
  ans:
  - you could be hurt by these ruffians.

- que:
  - are you gonna be able to do it?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure, of course.

- que:
  - what about dinner?
  ans:
  - you probably don't have any food.

- que:
  - what exactly do you hope to get out of therapy?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i think i like the euphoria i get from these encounters.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - is that what i'm thinking or is that what you're thinking?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - how so?
  ans:
  - not his, not ours.

- que:
  - is that it?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i found one.

- que:

  ans:
  - sort of.

- que:

  ans:
  - his little hat is cute, so pointy.

- que:
  - can you imagine having a member of your family cremated... and then not caring enough to pick up their ashes?
  ans:
  - i think sometimes it's too hard for people to acknowledge... that someone they loved is now just chunks of soot.

- que:
  - didn't i say i would?
  ans:
  - sure, swordfish is fine.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because, if you aren't, things come up... and you've no idea how big the thing's gonna be.

- que:
  - what's that got to do with it?
  ans:
  - everything.

- que:
  - who eliminated nyman?
  ans:
  - someone he had given a hard time.

- que:

  - want to grab a cup of coffee?
  ans:
  - i'il stick to tea instead.

- que:
  - did you know nyman?
  ans:
  - yes, indeed.

- que:
  - when was that?

  - want to know how its done?
  ans:
  - you start out by cutting its tongue out.

- que:

  ans:
  - no...

- que:
  - you were a paratrooper, right?
  ans:
  - no, that's going too far.

- que:
  - then wouldn't he have been reported several times?
  ans:
  - you know where those complaints are filed, in the wastebasket.

- que:
  - what about a higher authority?
  ans:
  - aren't you naive...

- que:
  - you left, what do we do now?
  ans:
  - we've got loads to do.

- que:
  - ls that all right with you?
  ans:

- que:
  - like how to commit perjury?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i think about my 30 years on the force.

- que:

  - will that be all, or should we go further back in time?
  ans:
  - no, this will be fine.

- que:
  - has rnn come back to the office yet?
  ans:
  - oh, he hasn't...

- que:
  - could we talk about something else?
  ans:
  - you look perky.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - 20 complaints during the past few years.

- que:
  - and maybe even a massage?
  ans:
  - i won't lie to you, i had a massage.

- que:
  - it's worth a try, isn't it?
  ans:
  - right...

- que:
  - why don't we check out ten names each?
  ans:
  - oh...

- que:
  - mrs nyman, is it correct that only you, your son, and your husband's two brothers knew which room he was in?
  ans:
  - that's correct.

- que:
  - she told him which hospital it was.
  ans:
  - ls hult in?

- que:
  - i wonder why he called?
  ans:
  - maybe he wanted to send flowers.

- que:
  - why would he call at night?
  ans:
  - at this time of the year, any time after 5:30 pm is night.

- que:

- que:
  - do you think hult stabbed nyman?
  ans:
  - i would like to discuss that call with him, though.

- que:
  - as what?
  ans:
  - that's my name.

- que:
  - what do mean?
  ans:
  - that it's strange that hult calls nyman's wife and introduces himself as\"palmon harold hult\".

- que:
  - how do you know his name?
  ans:
  - you wrote it down on your pad.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it's also listed in the complaint ke eriksson lodged.

- que:
  - how can i help you this time?
  ans:
  - it's about that telephone call.

- que:
  - did you recognize his voice?
  ans:
  - no, i don't know the man.

- que:
  - wouldn't it be simpler if you talked to sergeant hult?
  ans:
  - policemen make enemies.

- que:
  - are you aware of the fact that we've talked five times during the past 12 hours?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, maybe i'd better get to the point.

- que:
  - are you joking?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what were the charges?
  ans:

- que:
  - what about eriksson?
  ans:
  - he was an artilleryman.

- que:
  - are you thinking of the bayonet?
  ans:

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - you can buy them for peanuts.

- que:
  - was this done in a rational or frenzied manner?
  ans:
  - i'd say it was a combination of rage and cool calculation.

- que:
  - lasse, could you climb in through the window?
  ans:
  - thanks...

- que:
  - what happened to ke eriksson?
  ans:
  - well, i'm not a psychiatrist...

- que:
  - do you have to do that?
  ans:
  - back in those days, your son was a top marksman on the force.

- que:

  - if money equals fucking, then we just fuck.

- que:
  - you mean with a woman?
  ans:
  - if one person is having fun, if he's totally into it and he completely lets go, the whole group starts to believe in it too.

  - we all want it more or less, right?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - we just have to get rid of the\"more or less, \"right?
  ans:
  - in other words, our problem is that we're humans... and not primitive animals and we're uptight about fucking.

- que:
  - do you need it?
  ans:
  - i thought you liked women.

- que:
  - what's your problem?
  ans:
  - everyone just slept with everyone.

- que:
  - you want me to film you?
