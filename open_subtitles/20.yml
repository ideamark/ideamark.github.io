  - that's insane.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - my name next to yours on everything we do.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - i'm dean.

- que:
  - how do you know my name?
  ans:
  - because i'm working for abbott.

- que:
  - she's not to be told what we're doing down here, all right?
  ans:
  - as far as she knows, we're just observing and studying her.

- que:
  - the same thing happen to sara?
  ans:
  - no, no, no.

- que:
  - have i stood in your way, sara?
  ans:
  - this is your home, not a prison.

- que:
  - that's the plan, right?
  ans:
  - certainly.

- que:
  - she came back last night, didn't she?
  ans:
  - sara has eliminated our species as potential partners.

- que:
  - hey, you know this project athena?
  ans:
  - seems this guy, dr. fitch, already tried growing a creature from its own dna.

- que:
  - how's she gonna feel about this?
  ans:
  - sara doesn't have any feelings.

- que:
  - may i help you?
  ans:
  - i need a room.

- que:
  - what is this?
  ans:
  - it's chess.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - white moves first.

- que:
  - how can you do that?
  ans:
  - i have to sleep now.

- que:
  - what happened to your hand?
  ans:
  - it was a bunsen burner.

- que:
  - come on, she can't look like that and be a biochemist.
  ans:
  - seen the departmental website today?

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i gotta see just how crazy this chick is.

- que:
  - have you done any unusual lab work in protoplastic cell suspension?
  ans:
  - specifically.

- que:
  - any kind of transmembrane conductivity and permeability diffusion?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for a man who has measured pore coefficients greater than 10e minus 16 meters squared per second.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - mass e mail.

- que:
  - wasn't that shut down?
  ans:
  - i want this girl found.

- que:
  - feelings?
  ans:
  - she's just gonna break your heart.

- que:
  - who said i had feelings for her?
  ans:
  - i understand the temptation, of course.

- que:
  - listen, i know she's not attracted to humans, all right?
  ans:
  - everything she does is only in her own biological interest.

- que:
  - no one knows anything about this, right?
  ans:
  - of course not.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i'd prefer it if dean took my blood.

- que:
  - dean?
  ans:
  - very well.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - the first night of her maturity.

- que:
  - absurd... can't possibly end like this.
  ans:
  - listen to me, all right?

- que:
  - i don't understand.
  ans:
  - no, it's not, okay?

- que:
  - you see that thing there?
  ans:
  - that contains your eggs.

- que:
  - alien ova, you understand?
  ans:
  - the half breeds need it so they can create a viable continuation of their line.

- que:
  - what about me?
  ans:
  - sara, you could have a lifespan of 400 years, for all i know.

- que:
  - and if i don't reproduce, the threat to your own species ends with me?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - sara, are you in here?
  ans:
  - we sh shouldn't do this.

- que:
  - yeah, of course i do, but... why do you want me?
  ans:
  - i just do.

- que:
  - why don't you just think of it as a simple exchange of services?
  ans:
  - fuck it.

- que:
  - what about abbott?
  ans:
  - he's gone, dude... went missing.

- que:
  - amelia?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - the honey on the internet?
  ans:
  - the one who wanted the information on electroporation.

- que:
  - you got in touch with her?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what are you talking about, hastings?
  ans:
  - you left your notebook here one day.

- que:
  - so what the hell is it?
  ans:
  - look, i just...

- que:
  - i can't tell you right now, all right?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - did i have any contact with alien life?
  ans:
  - at that point, i'm like, \"all right, the chick really is crazy.

- que:
  - this is a gas station, right?
  ans:
  - fill it up.

- que:
  - you sure you don't need something else?
  ans:
  - done worn him out.

- que:
  - lab?
  ans:
  - i wanna see it.

- que:
  - where did you get your specimen from, anyway?
  ans:
  - we never talked about that.

- que:
  - something wrong?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - who else lives here?
  ans:
  - no one.

- que:
  - okay... look... you know it was all a joke?
  ans:
  - the data i sent you was fake.

- que:
  - now why don't you just tell me where you got it from?
  ans:
  - i told you.

- que:
  - why kidnap your roommate?
  ans:
  - i can't be sure.

- que:
  - a new species?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - who'd you say you worked for?
  ans:
  - i didn't.

- que:
  - unfortunately, the current administration has much less of an appetite for science fiction, shall we say?
  ans:
  - so i'm not here in an official capacity, and we won't be taking care of this in an official capacity.

- que:
  - what are you gonna do?
  ans:
  - you and i are taking care of this in an unofficial capacity.

- que:
  - you can hack into abbott's database, right?
  ans:
  - yeah, i think so.

- que:
  - have you made any progress yet?
  ans:
  - it's confusing, all this stuff.

- que:
  - so what if he dies?
  ans:
  - there's a college campus here.

- que:
  - what are you looking at?
  ans:
  - abbott made physiology schematics of the aliens.

- que:
  - any weaknesses?
  ans:
  - the half breeds have failing immune systems, so we should be able to kill amelia with any common contaminant.

- que:
  - what kind of contaminant?
  ans:
  - hydrochlorine gas.

- que:
  - where do you think you're going?
  ans:
  - this isn't my problem.

- que:
  - what about later?
  ans:
  - you're our only hope.

- que:
  - what happens after that?
  ans:
  - we'il have to grow it to maturity in a solution of carbon based molecules... a membrane bag, basically.

- que:
  - what are you waiting for?
  ans:
  - please... don't make me do this.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - they should be coming out soon.

- que:
  - so... how's things?
  ans:
  - wonderful.

- que:
  - is this them?
  ans:
  - yeah, the dna and ova cells.

- que:
  - who's this guy?
  ans:
  - my driver.

- que:
  - tokamak depressurizing.
  ans:
  - where in the hell's dean?

- que:
  - what are you guys up to, anyway?
  ans:
  - he's taken control of the reactor.

- que:
  - something wrong with my face?
  ans:
  - one last thing.

- que:
  - yeah.
  ans:
  - why?

- que:
  - how ya feeling?
  ans:
  - not bad.

- que:
  - did you see wasach on tv?
  ans:
  - yeah... said you should come see him sometime in washington when you're feeling better.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - it's all cool.

- que:
  - you hungry?
  ans:
  - yeah, sure.

- que:
  - what the hell is going on here?
  ans:
  - i'm just doing a little cleanup.

- que:
  - what did you do?
  ans:
  - there was still some remnants of the half breed dna, so i stripped away the damaging human strains and created him.

- que:
  - why'd you do it?
  ans:
  - maybe you'il find the answer to that someday.

- que:
  - i didn't say he was fertile, did i?
  ans:
  - you mean, you made him...

- que:
  - what happens once they figure out he's sterile?
  ans:
  - none other.

- que:
  - what happened to him?
  ans:
  - which brings me to the second course.

- que:
  - have you heard of it?
  ans:
  - i have not.

- que:
  - looped off?
  ans:
  - clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

- que:
  - will you do this?
  ans:
  - i shall.

- que:
  - is it theodore?
  ans:
  - i am only a stranger.

- que:
  - can we proceed?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - the heads are gone?
  ans:
  - taken.

- que:
  - is that what you believe?
  ans:
  - seeing is believing.

- que:
  - and the head..?
  ans:
  - taken...

- que:
  - what is?
  ans:
  - in cases like this, the head is removed to prevent identification of the body.

- que:
  - so why was it removed?
  ans:
  - because.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - the wound was cauterised, as though the blade were red hot.

- que:
  - the fifth?
  ans:
  - aye.

- que:
  - operate?
  ans:
  - to what is your purpose, is the question.

- que:
  - what type of instruments are these?
  ans:
  - some of my own design.

- que:
  - what did you find out?
  ans:
  - the widow winship was with child.

- que:
  - who's there?
  ans:
  - oh, pardon my intrusion.

- que:
  - why did no one mention that the van garretts are kin to the van tassels?
  ans:
  - hardly a household is not connected to every other by blood or marriage.

- que:
  - should i show you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - are you so certain of everything?
  ans:
  - it was your mother's.

- que:
  - what are these strange markings?
  ans:
  - i've had them since i can remember.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - carved into the fireback.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yes, thank you.

- que:
  - what are you running from, philipse?
  ans:
  - you had a mind to help me.

- que:
  - you knew the widow was expecting?
  ans:
  - she told me.

- que:
  - did she tell you the father's name?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what is that thing?
  ans:
  - my protection from the horseman.

- que:
  - who's with me?
  ans:
  - the van garretts, widow winship, your father, and now philipse.

- que:
  - did your father deal with the van garretts?
  ans:
  - he worked for them.

- que:
  - the hessian?
  ans:
  - that'il be him.

- que:
  - what might he hear that he must keep away from?
  ans:
  - he rides to the hollow and back.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - well, i'm here to find him and make him stop.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - don't move or speak.

- que:
  - madam, do you hear me?
  ans:
  - you seek the warrior bathed in blood, the headless horseman.

- que:
  - how will we recognise it?
  ans:
  - without difficulty, i fear.

- que:
  - his camp?
  ans:
  - his grave.

- que:
  - why have you come?
  ans:
  - because no one else would go with you.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - just stay where you are.

- que:
  - ichabod?
  ans:
  - split up.

- que:
  - oh, isn't there?
  ans:
  - let's get ready for bed.

- que:
  - murdered by..?
  ans:
  - murdered to save her soul.

- que:
  - what do you believe in?
  ans:
  - sense and reason.

- que:
  - you'il take nothing from sleepy hollow that was worth the coming here?
  ans:
  - no, not nothing.

- que:
  - do you think me wicked?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why do you say that?
  ans:
  - because you've bewitched me.

- que:
  - sarah?
  ans:
  - run away, like so many others.

- que:
  - where is katrina?
  ans:
  - she watched over you till dawn.

- que:
  - what is the secret that unites them?
  ans:
  - magistrate philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves.

- que:
  - what does this point to?
  ans:
  - we must proceed by process of elimination.

- que:
  - have you thought of something?
  ans:
  - yes...

- que:
  - why is it here?
  ans:
  - leave me alone.

- que:
  - widow winship?
  ans:
  - and here, look.

- que:
  - your will?
  ans:
  - because it is yours.

- que:
  - was it wicked of me?
  ans:
  - no, not at all.

- que:
  - where did you go?
  ans:
  - i had questions to ask hardenbrook.

- que:
  - did you learn anything of interest?
  ans:
  - perhaps.

- que:
  - why is that?
  ans:
  - perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw.

- que:
  - what have you there?
  ans:
  - evidence.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - help me move the bed.

- que:
  - why did his friends conceal..?
  ans:
  - you are the constable.

- que:
  - what peril was there if it was my father who controlled the horseman?
  ans:
  - goodbye.

- que:

  ans:
  - only that she will not come down.

- que:
  - how did you..?
  ans:
  - i know you saw me.

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - i was careless with the kitchen knife.

- que:
  - how can you think so?
  ans:
  - you are bewitched by reason.

- que:
  - did you think it was a nasty dream?
  ans:
  - father saw the horseman kill you.

- que:
  - he finally popped the question?
  ans:

- que:
  - how do you make yourself so somber and emotional to make everybody cry like that?
  ans:
  - it's not that hard, really.

- que:
  - i don't believe we've met, mr...?
  ans:
  - the name is spottswoode.

  - and sometimes you didn't want to know the end...... because how could the end be happy?

- que:
  - what are we holding on to, sam?
  ans:
  - that there's some good in this world, mr. frodo.

- que:

  - frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad?
  ans:
  - yes, my boy.

- que:
  - who are you?
  ans:
  - musn't ask us it's name not his business.

- que:
  - that was your name once, wasn't it?
  ans:
  - the white wizard approaches.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - they passed this way the day before yesterday.

- que:
  - gandalf?
  ans:
  - oh yes.

- que:
  - he is up to something.
  ans:
  - why haven't you spoke of this before?

- que:
  - are you saying is another way into mordor?
  ans:
  - be careful what you say.

- que:
  - no, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
  ans:
  - my lord.

- que:
  - why should i welcome you...... gandalf, gandalf stormcrow?
  ans:
  - a just question my lord.

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
  ans:
  - then i call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes ll.

- que:
  - would someone alert security?
  ans:
  - this is all a damned inconvenience.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - shut up.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - oh, very well, then.

- que:
  - you ever think about getting married again?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - captain, i do not think it is appropriate for a starfleet officer to appear... naked.

- que:
  - what can you be afraid of?
  ans:
  - captain, i am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarun system.

- que:
  - what sort of signature?
  ans:
  - positronic.

- que:
  - what do we know about it?
  ans:
  - uncharted.

- que:
  - theories?
  ans:
  - just what i was afraid of.

- que:
  - captain?
  ans:
  - diverting to the kolarus system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone.

- que:
  - a long lost relative?
  ans:
  - i'm reading six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the planet's surface.

- que:
  - what do we know about the population on kolarus ill?
  ans:
  - isolated pockets of humanoids.

- que:
  - why do you have a shiny head?
  ans:
  - this is not the appropriate time for a conversation.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because...

- que:
  - have i said something wrong?
  ans:
  - data.

- que:
  - so what have we got, geordi?
  ans:
  - well, i'd say he has the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic development.

- que:
  - do you have a name, sir?
  ans:
  - i am...

- que:
  - can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - do you remember anything of your life before you were on the planet?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why does the tall man have a furry face?
  ans:
  - number one, keep me informed and, uh, geordi, reassemble him.

- que:
  - b 4, do you know who i am?
  ans:
  - you are me.

- que:
  - with or without the rest of the fleet?
  ans:
  - a diplomatic mission.

- que:
  - new praetor?
  ans:
  - there's more.

- que:
  - romulus?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid the opal sea will have to wait, number one.

- que:
  - yeah, but how did a reman get to be praetor?
  ans:
  - i don't get it.

- que:
  - coup d'tat?
  ans:
  - praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet.

- que:
  - what have we learned about shinzon?
  ans:
  - starfleet lntelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.

- que:
  - you feel comfortable with that?
  ans:
  - i feel nothing, geordi.

- que:
  - b 4, do you know where you are?
  ans:
  - i am in a room with lights.

- que:
  - our father?
  ans:
  - yes, dr. soong.

- que:
  - do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
  ans:
  - captain...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - this.

- que:
  - do you mind if i keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
  ans:
  - no, i do not mind.

- que:
  - counselor?
  ans:
  - they're out there, sir.

- que:
  - praetor shinzon?
  ans:
  - captain picard.

- que:
  - isn't that odd?
  ans:
  - you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - you are human.

- que:
  - praetor?
  ans:
  - i've never met a human woman before.

- que:
  - may i touch your hair?
  ans:
  - we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.

- que:
  - am i right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you know of it, captain?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - in fact, i feel exactly what you feel... don't i, jean luc?
  ans:
  - come to dinner tomorrow on romulus, just the two of us.

- que:
  - or should i say... just the one of us?
  ans:
  - i think you'il be wanting this.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i have a purpose.

- que:
  - do i serve you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what must a woman do?
  ans:
  - you... are not a woman.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - as happens frequently here on romulus... a new government came to power.

- que:
  - our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
  ans:
  - and yours are so confident.

- que:
  - how did you end up on remus?
  ans:
  - they sent me there to die.

- que:
  - how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
  ans:
  - not that it mattered, as i was no longer part of their plans against the federation.

- que:
  - you're doing this to liberate the remans?
  ans:
  - i knew they would never give us our freedom.

- que:
  - and how many romulans died for your freedom?
  ans:
  - too many.

- que:
  - were we picards always warriors?
  ans:
  - i think of myself as an explorer.

- que:
  - well, were we always explorers?
  ans:
  - i was the first picard to leave our solar system.

- que:
  - source?
  ans:
  - it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.

- que:
  - what programs were accessed?
  ans:
  - well... that's what i can't figure out.

- que:
  - remember him?
  ans:
  - he was a bit cocky as i recall.

- que:
  - is he very much the way you were?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - deanna... what's the matter?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - deanna... can you describe it?
  ans:
  - it was a...

- que:
  - why have you done this?
  ans:
  - i was lonely.

- que:
  - what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - i need a sample of your blood.

- que:
  - what is it your borg friends say?
  ans:
  - resistance is futile.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - out of my sight.

- que:
  - what is all this about?
  ans:
  - it's about destiny, picard.

- que:
  - so what am l?
  ans:
  - senators, consider the opportunities for the empire.

- que:
  - do i make myself clear?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
  ans:
  - then i call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes il.

  ans:

- que:
  - b 4, do you know who i am?
  ans:
  - you are me.

- que:
  - with or without the rest of the fleet?
  ans:
  - a diplomatic mission.

- que:
  - new praetor?
  ans:
  - there's more.

- que:
  - romulus?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid the opal sea will have to wait, number one.

- que:
  - yeah, but how did a reman get to be praetor?
  ans:
  - i don't get it.

- que:
  - coup d'etat?
  ans:
  - praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet.

- que:
  - what have we learned about shinzon?
  ans:
  - starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.

- que:
  - you feel comfortable with that?
  ans:
  - i feel nothing, geordi.

- que:
  - b 4, do you know where you are?
  ans:
  - i am in a room with lights.

- que:
  - our father?
  ans:
  - yes, dr. soong.

- que:
  - do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
  ans:
  - captain...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - this.

- que:
  - do you mind if i keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
  ans:
  - no, i do not mind.

- que:
  - counselor?
  ans:
  - they're out there, sir.

- que:
  - praetor shinzon?
  ans:
  - captain picard.

- que:
  - isn't that odd?
  ans:
  - you may scan me without subterfuge, commander data.

- que:
  - no?
  ans:
  - you are human.

- que:
  - praetor?
  ans:
  - i've never met a human woman before.

- que:
  - may i touch your hair?
  ans:
  - we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.

- que:
  - am i right?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - do you know of it, captain?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - in fact, i feel exactly what you feel... don't i, jean luc?
  ans:
  - come to dinner... tomorrow on romulus, just the two of us.

- que:
  - or should i say... just the one of us?
  ans:
  - i think you'il be wanting this.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i intend to find out, number one.

- que:
  - what possible purpose could that serve?
  ans:
  - i have a purpose.

- que:
  - do i serve you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what must a woman do?
  ans:
  - you... are not a woman.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - as happens frequently here on romulus... a new government came to power.

- que:
  - our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
  ans:
  - and yours are so confident.

- que:
  - how did you end up on remus?
  ans:
  - they sent me there to die.

- que:
  - how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
  ans:
  - not that it mattered, as i was no longer part of their plans against the federation.

- que:
  - you're doing this to liberate the remans?
  ans:
  - i knew they would never give us our freedom.

- que:
  - and how many romulans died for your freedom?
  ans:
  - too many.

- que:
  - were we picards always warriors?
  ans:
  - i think of myself as an explorer.

- que:
  - well, were we always explorers?
  ans:
  - i was the first picard to leave our solar system.

- que:
  - source?
  ans:
  - it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.

- que:
  - what programs were accessed?
  ans:
  - well... that's what i can't figure out.

- que:
  - remember him?
  ans:
  - he was a bit cocky as i recall.

- que:
  - is he very much the way you were?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - deanna... what's the matter?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - deanna... can you describe it?
  ans:
  - it was a...

- que:
  - why have you done this?
  ans:
  - i was lonely.

- que:
  - what are you going to do?
  ans:
  - i need a sample of your blood.

- que:
  - what is it your borg friends say?
  ans:
  - resistance is futile.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - out of my sight.

- que:
  - what is all this about?
  ans:
  - it's about destiny, picard.

- que:
  - so what am i?
  ans:
  - my life is meaningless as long as you're still alive.

- que:
  - an echo?
  ans:
  - if your issues are with me, then deal with me.

- que:
  - are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
  ans:
  - it amazes me how little you know yourself.

- que:
  - what about the download?
  ans:
  - shinzon believes he has our communication protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels.

- que:
  - data, what do you imagine this is?
  ans:
  - port thruster, sir.

- que:
  - data, can you open the shuttlebay doors?
  ans:
  - negative, sir.

- que:
  - do you think this is a wise course of action, sir?
  ans:
  - we're about to find out, data.

- que:
  - does that satisfy you?
  ans:
  - for the moment.

- que:
  - what's happening to his face?
  ans:
  - commander, a moment.

- que:
  - are you truly prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?
  ans:
  - he's not planning to defeat earth.

- que:
  - can anything be done for him?
  ans:
  - nothing except a complete transfusion from the only donor with compatible dna... you.

- que:
  - how long does he have?
  ans:
  - i can't say for sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because you are dangerous.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

- que:
  - do you know anything about shinzon's plans against the federation?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - can i move now?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i must deactivate you.

- que:
  - for how long?
  ans:
  - indefinitely.

- que:
  - how long is tha...?
  ans:
  - a long time, brother.

- que:
  - how can you be certain?
  ans:
  - i know how he thinks.

- que:
  - no way of penetrating his cloak?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you understand me?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - how long?
  ans:
  - a matter of hours.

- que:
  - how long until we reach the rift?
  ans:
  - seven minutes.

- que:
  - how soon until we reach the fleet?
  ans:
  - at our current velocity, we will arrive at sector 1045 in approximately 40 minutes, sir.

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - he said he is a mirror.

- que:
  - of you, sir?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would've rejected my humanity?
  ans:
  - the b 4 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.

- que:
  - how can you be sure?
  ans:
  - i aspire, sir, to be better than i am.

- que:
  - it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?
  ans:
  - the rift affects all long range communica...

- que:
  - can you learn to see in the dark, captain?
  ans:
  - report.

- que:
  - captain picard... will you join me in your ready room?
  ans:
  - you can't trace my holographic emitters, captain, so don't bother.

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - to accept your surrender.

- que:
  - and the enterprise?
  ans:
  - i have little interest in your quaint vessel, captain.

- que:
  - waste it in a blaze of hatred?
  ans:
  - there is a better way.

- que:
  - assistance?
  ans:
  - the empire considers this a matter of internal security.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you heard me.

- que:
  - do you have life support?
  ans:
  - for the moment.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - she's here.

- que:
  - did you check the system status?
  ans:
  - report.

- que:
  - what if we targeted all our phasers in a concentrated pattern?
  ans:
  - the scimitar's shields are still at 70 percent.

- que:
  - what's he doing?
  ans:
  - he wants to look me in the eye.

- que:
  - why should the rest of your crew have to die?
  ans:
  - shinzon, i don't think i ever told you... about my first academy evaluation.

- que:
  - some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, jean luc?
  ans:
  - thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

- que:
  - how long until he can fire?
  ans:
  - the targeting sequence should take about seven minutes, captain.

- que:
  - how can he?
  ans:
  - he'il kill you.

- que:
  - data?
  ans:
  - captain...

- que:
  - what was that song?
  ans:
  - can't remember the song.

- que:
  - so... where's the titan off to?
  ans:
  - the neutral zone.

- que:
  - if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
  ans:
  - anything.

- que:
  - my... my brother was not human?
  ans:
  - no, he wasn't.

- que:
  - who's on first?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - dear, who do you think is on first?
  ans:
  - i'il have the turkey club without the bacon.

- que:
  - you think you can beat me up?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours.

- que:
  - is she not terrific?
  ans:
  - she does have a way.

- que:
  - you think she thinks i have a beautiful face?
  ans:
  - well, they do work on tips.

- que:
  - who says that?
  ans:
  - she is really cool.

- que:
  - you think she likes me?
  ans:
  - i should've got the egg white omelet.

- que:
  - who am i?
  ans:
  - there's a million people to like.

- que:
  - is it that far fetched?
  ans:
  - maybe she sees something.

- que:
  - is it possible?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you were gone?
  ans:
  - i went to england.

- que:
  - how was it?
  ans:
  - actually, it was great.

- que:

  - oh, a walk?
  ans:
  - well...

- que:
  - or something?
  ans:
  - yeah, that's a date.

- que:

- que:
  - you did?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - you said you liked horse manure?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - oh, you think because of what i said about the manure?
  ans:
  - i was just saying how it takes a negative thing...... and puts a positive spin on it.

- que:
  - my honest opinion?
  ans:
  - i think she made it up.

- que:
  - well, then she's just a liar, isn't she?
  ans:
  - hey.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - could you put it in a big bowl?
  ans:
  - we don't have big bowls.

- que:
  - is there any way that could happen?
  ans:
  - i mean, i know how to get myself fired.

- que:
  - how do i get someone else fired?
  ans:
  - well, as i see it...... you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired...... but redirected outwardly.

- que:
  - no food?
  ans:
  - well, you gotta have something.

- que:
  - why did she get fired?
  ans:
  - because i called over there a couple of times...... and the manager didn't like it.

- que:
  - boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
  ans:
  - yes, he's one of those bounders.

- que:

  ans:
  - thanks again, hon.

  ans:
  - and talk about our mutual interest and show each other what we have collected so far in the way of tapes or paraphernalia or photographs.

- que:
  - and i thought, \"they're inviting me to new y ork?
  ans:

  - can i have a schedule, please?
  ans:
  - ah.

- que:

  ans:
  - i wouldn't have left without it.

- que:
  - and i held up the glass and i said, \"who would be interested in purchasing the q virus?
  ans:
  - and it was kind of a joke, but the crowd just went absolutely crazy.

- que:
  - he said, \"are you q?
  ans:
  - and i said, \"y eah.

- que:
  - can you bring people back from the dead?
  ans:
  - he was still doing the same thing 20 years later.

- que:
  - there's one gentleman who for about, what, 10 years?
  ans:
  - almost the whole run.

- que:
  - and why is he sending us these things?
  ans:
  - and if you over 10 years, every day, that's quite a few packages.

- que:
  - and what makes you a fanatic as opposed to a fan?
  ans:
  - i think the fact that i'm so much into it.

- que:
  - and they came scrambling out of that place, and the first thing they did was ask us, \"can we have your autographs, please?
  ans:
  - we went there to get their autographs, and they in turn were asking us for ours.

- que:
  - how are you?
  ans:
  - pleasure to see you.

- que:
  - you thinking what i'm thinking?
  ans:
  - and we said, \"let's try it.

- que:
  - every morning you come in, you wonder, \"well, what's going to be on these walls that wasn't here before?
  ans:
  - the uniform i wouldn't do at first.

- que:
  - and you just how long did you hold out?
  ans:
  - uh, about almost a year.

- que:
  - what made you finally turn the corner?
  ans:
  - he told me i had to.

- que:
  - really?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - and how do the patients respond?

  ans:
  - everything she does is right, and everything i do is wrong.

- que:
  - yes?
  ans:
  - it's miep.

- que:

- que:
  - who knows who might be in the street?
  ans:
  - she's endangering our lives.

- que:
  - she'il be herself in a minute or two, won't you, annie?
  ans:

- que:
  - do you think that you could?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid with him gone a week, peter....

  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is wrong?
  ans:
  - father is going to sell her fur coat.

- que:
  - it's mine, you hear me?
  ans:

- que:
  - so if you please, sell it for us?
  ans:
  - it should fetch a good price.

- que:
  - and by the way...... would you get me cigarettes?
  ans:
  - i don't care what kind, get all you can.

- que:
  - what's happened?
  ans:
  - if it is something that concerns us here, we'd better all hear it.

- que:
  - what do you hear from your friend mr. frank?
  ans:
  - i said there's a rumor you were in switzerland.

- que:
  - was not there a door here leading to the loft?
  ans:
  - then he asked me for more money.

- que:
  - 20 guilders?
  ans:
  - very modest blackmail.

- que:
  - you know what i think?
  ans:
  - he's the thief who was down there that night.

- que:
  - what did you tell him?
  ans:
  - i told him i had to think about it.

- que:
  - take a chance on firing him, or what?
  ans:
  - i do not know.

- que:
  - what are they paying nowadays?
  ans:
  - he could get it in a war plant.

- que:
  - we've got to pay, haven't we?
  ans:
  - whatever he asks, we've got to pay.

- que:
  - what does that mean, the telephone ringing on a holiday?
  ans:
  - that's my wife.

- que:
  - she talks as if we started the war.
  ans:
  - what's the good of that?

- que:
  - did we start the war?
  ans:
  - you left this.

- que:
  - isn't it funny, you and l?
  ans:
  - here we've been together all this time...... and this is the first time we've ever really talked.

- que:
  - it helps a lot to have someone to talk to, doesn't it?
  ans:
  - it helps you let off steam.

- que:
  - i said it, didn't l?
  ans:
  - good night.

- que:
  - may i come in?
  ans:
  - no, i'm not dressed yet.

- que:
  - tell me, am i terribly ugly?
  ans:
  - oh, stop fishing.

- que:
  - may i come in?
  ans:
  - come in, mother.

- que:
  - you're not going in again tonight to see peter?
  ans:
  - that is my intention.

- que:
  - aren't you afraid you're disturbing him?
  ans:
  - mother, i have some intuition.

- que:
  - then may i ask this much, annie?
  ans:
  - don't shut the door when you go in.

- que:
  - talk?
  ans:
  - that's not what they called it when i was a girl.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i mean, every time i go into peter's room...... i have the feeling that i'm hurting you.

- que:
  - will you please let me in my room?
  ans:
  - just a minute, dear mr. dussel.

- que:
  - do you mind?
  ans:
  - peter, i do not want you staying up till all hours tonight.

- que:
  - aren't you, annie?
  ans:
  - yes, mother.

- que:
  - may we go now?
  ans:
  - listen for the chimes, dear.

- que:
  - aren't they impossible?
  ans:
  - treating us as if we're still in the nursery.

- que:
  - already i know what i want to do, don't you?
  ans:
  - i want to be a journalist or something.

- que:
  - what do you want to do?
  ans:
  - i know what i'd like right now.

- que:
  - you like margot, don't you?
  ans:
  - right from the start, you liked her.

- que:
  - i have?
  ans:
  - i used to think that you were awful noisy.

- que:
  - how have i changed?
  ans:
  - well...... you're quieter.

- que:
  - now, what did i ever see in that miss quack quack?
  ans:
  - i haven't got any friends.

- que:
  - does that mean you can get along without me too?
  ans:
  - i think of myself as your friend.

- que:
  - peter...... did you ever kiss a girl?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - the girl you kissed?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - i don't suppose that really counts, does it?
  ans:
  - it didn't with me.

- que:
  - you wouldn't say those counted, would you?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't say so.

- que:
  - do you think a girl shouldn't kiss anyone except if she's engaged or something?
  ans:
  - it's so hard to try to think what to do.

- que:
  - what do you think?
  ans:
  - i suppose it depends on the girl.

- que:
  - you won't let them stop you from coming?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what kind of things?
  ans:
  - well...... i wouldn't want you to see some of it.

- que:
  - did you change your mind?
  ans:
  - mr. van daan.

- que:
  - mr. van daan, how could you?
  ans:
  - i'm hungry.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - just that.

- que:
  - mr. van daan, i know this is never going to happen again, is it?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - mrs. frank, you would put us out on the street?
  ans:
  - you can find another hiding place.

- que:
  - a closet?
  ans:
  - mr. frank...

- que:
  - see what he's doing?
  ans:
  - \"i'm standing by...... to bring news of the invasion.

- que:
  - but it is mr. kraler.
  ans:
  - did you hear?

- que:
  - isn't it wonderful?
  ans:
  - when the nurse told me the news...... i said, \"there's only one place to be, with my friends.

- que:
  - mr. van daan.
  ans:
  - putti, what is it?

- que:
  - didn't you hear?
  ans:
  - we are going to be liberated.

- que:
  - who knows?
  ans:
  - i may be back in school by fall.

- que:
  - i can shake off everything if i write, but...... and that is the great question, will i ever be able to write well?
  ans:
  - i want to so much.

- que:
  - mr. frank, do you hear?
  ans:
  - yes, i hear.

- que:
  - you with the diary there, what day is it?
  ans:
  - i don't lose track of the days.

- que:
  - whose fault is it we're here?
  ans:
  - we could've been safe in america or switzerland.

- que:
  - aren't the clouds beautiful?
  ans:
  - what a lovely, lovely day.

- que:
  - you know what i do...... when i think i can't stand another minute of being cooped up?
  ans:
  - i think myself outside.

- que:
  - you know...... the most wonderful part of thinking yourself outside?
  ans:
  - you can have it any way you like.

- que:
  - isn't that wonderful?
  ans:
  - when i was outside, i used to take it all for granted.

- que:
  - but you know what i sometimes think?
  ans:
  - i think the world may be going through a phase...... the way i was with mother.

- que:
  - goodbye for a while.
  ans:
  - isn't it lovely?

- que:
  - each time the train would stop...... we'd all get out at a siding or a crossing...... and walk from group to group.
  ans:
  - p. s., please, please, anyone...... if you should find this diary, will you please keep it safe for me?

- que:
  - my daughter?

- que:
  - i hardly dare ask you... could i paint her?
  ans:
  - she might not feel comfortable here.

- que:
  - could you come upstairs?
  ans:
  - gladly.

- que:
  - can i say that?
  ans:
  - we'd probably say \"in their natural habitat.

- que:
  - are you russian?
  ans:
  - not me.

- que:
  - is she being good?
  ans:
  - good as gold.

- que:
  - fernande?
  ans:
  - the girl from upstairs.

- que:
  - do you like it?
  ans:
  - guess what she does.

- que:
  - ancient greek?

  - did you meet the husband?
  ans:
  - he was at a meeting.

- que:

- que:
  - shouldn't i?
  ans:
  - i don't hide it.

- que:
  - he's a teacher too?
  ans:

- que:
  - are you spying on them?
  ans:
  - this is for you.

- que:
  - how can we thank you?
  ans:
  - let me use the spare sketches for another painting.

- que:
  - a painting of what?
  ans:
  - i don't know yet.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - but i doubt it's your kind of painting.

- que:
  - you know her?
  ans:
  - but i can read russian.

- que:
  - not your taste?
  ans:
  - it's not that.

- que:
  - is your art for yourself or to sell?
  ans:
  - i've sold some to friends, but even that is hard.

  ans:
  - that's beside the point.

- que:
  - an embarrassing fact?
  ans:
  - like any unforeseen event, but politicians have to adapt.

- que:
  - but as a citizen yourself, don't you have a gut reaction?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - no hostility?
  ans:
  - no true communist opposes the will of the oppressed.

- que:
  - why do you communists oppose revolution?
  ans:
  - we oppose an abortive revolution that would surely end in repression, snuffing out the fresh hope lit by the popular front.

- que:
  - petit bourgeois, catholics... orthodox?
  ans:
  - and protestants, of course, muslims in the colonies... even white russians.

- que:
  - even generals?

  - yes, i work as a taxi driver.

- que:
  - can't you take me on the white army staff?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not.

- que:
  - have you gone communist?
  ans:
  - i live in a communist country, or almost.

- que:
  - in what way?
  ans:
  - by flushing out nostalgic and revanchist sentiments.

- que:
  - what can we do?
  ans:
  - but don't worry, i still think communism's a utopia, bound to collapse from within.

- que:
  - do you swallow what they say?
  ans:
  - the thing is, they don't actually say it.

- que:
  - you fell for it?
  ans:
  - it's a fake, planted by ultra militarists and corvignolles agents.

- que:
  - heard of it?
  ans:
  - you seem well informed.

- que:
  - who told you?
  ans:
  - i never name my sources.

- que:
  - and how do you know i'm not a cagoule member?
  ans:
  - if you were, you wouldn't say.

- que:
  - i pull strings.
  ans:
  - don't you believe me?

- que:
  - i know what you mean, but how?
  ans:
  - that... is a trade secret.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - no, nothing.

- que:
  - what things?
  ans:
  - for example, you wouldn't attend that conference in spain.

- que:
  - didn't i tell you?
  ans:
  - perhaps not.

- que:
  - so you have no state secrets?
  ans:
  - some.

- que:
  - i have to learn about them second hand.
  ans:
  - but as for the other... non secrets?

- que:
  - such as?
  ans:
  - your refusal to go to spain.

- que:
  - everything i can?
  ans:
  - no, fedya.

- que:
  - the one thing that bothers me about you and could slightly put me off you is the way you try to justify your... reticence?
  ans:
  - i think that's the word.

- que:
  - you know that word?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - how can i put it more plainly?
  ans:
  - i'm sworn to secrecy.

- que:
  - you should take some precautions.
  ans:
  - april why close it?

- que:
  - what did the doctor say?
  ans:
  - i'm better, but still fragile and prone to infection.

- que:
  - did he give you a tonic?
  ans:
  - he says ideally we'd live in the country.

- que:
  - the suburbs?
  ans:
  - they're either lower class and grim or expensive.

- que:
  - for us?
  ans:
  - fine.

- que:
  - but i'm not sure we can accept.
  ans:
  - so?

- que:
  - like it?
  ans:
  - of course, but... no buts.

- que:
  - i love how you've arranged the furniture.
  ans:
  - never leave a house empty, right?

- que:
  - don't you feel cut off and bored?
  ans:
  - people will visit us.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - some time ago.

- que:
  - i don't see... you're sure it was berlin?
  ans:
  - my brother in law lgor saw him.

- que:
  - yes, but did he speak to him?
  ans:
  - he saw him through a cafe window.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - i didn't want to say it, but you should be prepared for certain rumours.

- que:
  - what rumours?
  ans:
  - some official building with an endless german name.

- que:
  - june arsinoe, have you seen my bag?
  ans:
  - there it is.

- que:
  - like in november?
  ans:
  - yes, to brussels.

- que:
  - and then?
  ans:
  - then i'il come home.

- que:
  - who said that?
  ans:
  - only dobrinsky and i knew.

- que:
  - which one?
  ans:
  - she doesn't know.

- que:
  - is that all?
  ans:
  - i think not.

- que:
  - you think i'm delirious?
  ans:
  - hardly.

- que:
  - will you forgive me?
  ans:
  - i was only half listening.

- que:
  - who'd know that i knew?
  ans:
  - it would get around.

- que:
  - who would be asking me?
  ans:
  - anyone.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it's clear.

- que:
  - don't you agree?
  ans:
  - yes, i believe you.

- que:
  - does your husband?
  ans:
  - he thinks... well, i don't know.

- que:
  - do you really disagree?
  ans:
  - sorry.

- que:
  - you think the charges were all trumped up?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - so stalin's a dove?
  ans:
  - just now, yes.

- que:
  - are you sure?
  ans:
  - positive.

- que:
  - so why are the french communists so violently against pacifists such as emery and bergery?
  ans:
  - because the views from paris and moscow are different.

- que:
  - so why's he sending volunteers and aircraft to spain?
  ans:
  - first, because the fascists and nazis went in first.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - to hide what he's up to.

- que:
  - i'm sure you'il love it.
  ans:
  - which is?

- que:
  - what's it called?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - aren't you hungry?
  ans:
  - not very.

- que:
  - you're not suggesting we go to america?
  ans:
  - no, another country.

- que:
  - not germany?
  ans:
  - no, russia.

- que:
  - why would they take me?
  ans:
  - i'il go with you.

- que:
  - what is this wild idea?
  ans:
  - not so wild.

- que:
  - would you want me to?
  ans:
  - i'm deadly serious.

- que:
  - told what?
  ans:
  - specific things that will soon be more specific.

- que:
  - you don't think i'd fight for mr hitler, do you?
  ans:
  - i don't like the germans.

- que:
  - what did i refuse to tell him?
  ans:
  - presumably, the germans were keen to compromise the red army chief, knowing stalin was down on him.

- que:
  - are you crying?
  ans:
  - i'm not crying.

- que:
  - isn't it all too good to be true?
  ans:
  - maybe i'm gullible too, but... i'il risk it.

- que:
  - you're smiling?
  ans:
  - you don't have to believe me.

- que:
  - you see?
  ans:
  - my remark about the purges wasn't a tasteless joke.

- que:
  - the only thing that could stop me accepting is... yes?
  ans:
  - yes, it's you.

- que:
  - sound good?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - the real risk to your health and others, more nebulous but very possible?
  ans:
  - i'm a fly in the ointment.

- que:
  - and for wednesday's cocktail party?
  ans:
  - i've got nothing.

- que:
  - would you mind?
  ans:
  - i have shopping to do and people to see.

- que:
  - rightist provocation?
  ans:
  - too far fetched.

- que:
  - what do you think, general?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - do you have a hunch?
  ans:
  - none.

- que:
  - does it hurt when i press?
  ans:
  - it's deeper.

- que:
  - my dress isn't ready?
  ans:
  - you said late morning.

- que:
  - so, is the dress ready?
  ans:
  - i'm still waiting.

- que:
  - how about some shoes?
  ans:
  - i like these.

- que:
  - won't dobrinsky be there?
  ans:
  - no, i doubt it.

- que:
  - may we pay our respects to general dobrinsky?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid he may not be able to come and even if he does, it won't be before 8.

- que:
  - will it take long?
  ans:
  - we'il just look in.

- que:
  - ready to go home?
  ans:
  - yes, if you don't mind.

- que:
  - what's up?
  ans:
  - i think i've got myself into a mess.

- que:
  - when?
  ans:
  - this afternoon.

- que:
  - what could you have done?
  ans:
  - i shouldn't be telling you, but... i'm afraid you might be questioned unprepared.

- que:
  - questioned about what?
  ans:
  - how we spent the day.

- que:
  - unfortunately... what is it?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid dobrinsky's disappeared.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - plain disappeared.

- que:
  - wasn't he at home?
  ans:
  - no, but he was out late, anyway.

- que:
  - so?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid he's been kidnapped.

- que:
  - how do you know?
  ans:
  - we didn't see him all day.

- que:
  - where?
  ans:
  - near here.

- que:
  - like kutyepov?
  ans:
  - exactly.

- que:
  - who was in the car?
  ans:
  - two germans.

- que:
  - do you swear?
  ans:
  - i swear.

- que:
  - on your son's life?
  ans:
  - on principle.

- que:
  - while you waited for your dress, did anyone enter the room?
  ans:
  - no, from the moment you left until you returned.

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - i don't fully understand.

- que:
  - as he pretends to lean over to open the near door, the car roars off down the empty street.
  ans:
  - why should i have needed one?

- que:
  - didn't i tell you?
  ans:
  - the agent of a right wing anti nazi german industrialist was to leave it on a bench.

- que:
  - all done in what, five minutes?
  ans:
  - ten at the most.

- que:
  - where did he come from?
  ans:
  - strictly speaking, he wasn't a fake.

- que:
  - what would the russians gain?
  ans:
  - i can't see that either.

- que:
  - anyone can lose to a beginner.
  ans:
  - do another kutyepov?

- que:
  - like me, remember?
  ans:
  - but they're not beginners.

- que:
  - what threat could poor dobrinsky pose?
  ans:
  - then maybe it wasn't a kidnapping.

- que:
  - but why, for god's sake?
  ans:
  - it makes no sense.

- que:
  - parade him in russia, saying he retired to the soviet paradise?
  ans:
  - he'd never say it, even under torture.

- que:
  - as grotesque as the kidnapping itself.
  ans:
  - replace him with a lookalike?

- que:
  - do you think i'd lend myself to such a farrago?
  ans:
  - i understand you.

- que:
  - is it me they want to compromise?
  ans:
  - i know things they wish i didn't.

- que:
  - who do i mean by \"they\"?
  ans:
  - tchernov.

- que:
  - piotr pavlovitch, what's going on?
  ans:
  - sorry to bother you.

- que:
  - what do you mean?
  ans:
  - he didn't come home.

- que:
  - are they suspicious?
  ans:
  - no, but... i'm his deputy.

- que:
  - we're sorry to get you up in the dead of night, but do you know where general dobrinsky is?
  ans:
  - i've no idea.

- que:
  - when did he tell you that?
  ans:
  - yesterday.

- que:
  - you haven't seen him today?
  ans:
  - not today.

- que:
  - at one o'clock?
  ans:
  - at one, i was with my wife at her dressmaker's.

- que:
  - i am leaving this note, just in case.
  ans:
  - i repeat, did you arrange to meet him at 1:00 at la muette metro station?

- que:
  - do you recognize his handwriting?
  ans:
  - i think it's a forgery.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it can't be dobrinsky.

- que:
  - you saw how he flinched when you said one o'clock?
  ans:
  - keep a close eye on him.

- que:
  - where's voronin?
  ans:
  - he just left.

- que:
  - why is there no light?
  ans:
  - strange.

- que:
  - is that you?
  ans:
  - captain tchernov.

- que:
  - is he back?
  ans:
  - we're looking for him.

- que:
  - even at 1 p. m.?
  ans:
  - i was at my dressmaker's.

- que:
  - see these marks?
  ans:
  - they show the location of... the microphones.

- que:
  - will you follow me downstairs?
  ans:
  - semenov confessed.

- que:
  - remember the voronin case?
  ans:
  - the spy who kidnapped gen.

- que:
  - you think he hid here?
  ans:
  - most probably.

- que:
  - see?
  ans:
  - it cuts off the electricity in the stairs.

- que:
  - is she still in prison?
  ans:
  - no, she died.

- que:
  - be a sport, will ya?
  ans:
  - i missed ruthie's birthday dinner last night and she's makin 'my life hell in a handbasket.

- que:
  - what the hell is this?
  ans:
  - it's a russian pomeranian, larry.

- que:
  - if you're busting your ass, how come it's the size of a goddamn beanbag chair?
  ans:
  - if you put out once in a while, maybe i wouldn't be seeking carnal pleasure in food.

- que:
  - are you having sex?
  ans:
  - i think she's saying she's a whore, pop.

- que:
  - how come you don't have a girlfriend?
  ans:
  - she's just repeating what you said.

- que:
  - you mean a hit man?
  ans:
  - no, man.

- que:
  - you like it?
  ans:
  - i just got it cut..... by the most beautiful woman on the face of god's green earth.

- que:
  - who the hell cares?
  ans:
  - i tell you, she's well worth the price of a hat.

- que:
  - who's next?
  ans:
  - uh, right here.

- que:
  - so how do you like it?
  ans:
  - oh, you know, just...

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:

  ans:
  - actually, i didn't.

- que:
  - how's that for length?
  ans:
  - beautiful.

- que:
  - ringo?
  ans:
  - that must be a pretty popular name for a cat these days.

- que:
  - it is?
  ans:
  - no, but they tell me i'm first in line for an ear donor.

- que:
  - what are you doin 'tonight?

  - do you have one?
  ans:

- que:
  - did you and other david have an okay time last night?

  - no, i don't think so.

- que:
  - halle berry showed up and asked for a job?
  ans:
  - yeah, she did, and i told her she could have your room.

- que:
  - can't she, please?
  ans:
  - i'm supposed to keep this place safe for you.

- que:
  - besides, how would i explain this to david?
  ans:
  - don't tell him about it, that's how.

- que:
  - you don't think other david called him as soon as he got out of here last night?
  ans:
  - i can pretty much guarantee you that didn't happen.

- que:
  - you mean like when my husband died... and he left me and ray all alone with no money and no life insurance?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm familiar with that feeling.

- que:
  - so this is your room then?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - it's the accessories that really make the difference, don't you think?
  ans:
  - please don't make fun of me.

- que:
  - i'm sorry?
  ans:
  - i don't think i'm making my husband happy anymore.

- que:
  - you mean as opposed to, like, asking for my special recipe for meatloaf?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry, i had no business.

- que:
  - what's wrong?
  ans:
  - okay, here's the way that i figured it.

- que:
  - you know?
  ans:
  - and i could still be a good influence on her.

- que:
  - does she say that her mother's a fucking whore?
  ans:
  - yes, i'm back.

- que:
  - what do you think, boris?
  ans:
  - nice.

- que:
  - does it push my tits up enough?
  ans:
  - i get you a smaller size.

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - pretty.

- que:
  - mr. president, what are you waiting for?

  - fire scott, hardesty, dieffenbach, riley.

- que:
  - and then where do i stand?
  ans:
  - a lunatic.

- que:
  - would you allow me to strike that last idiotic remark?
  ans:
  - there's no need, jordie.

- que:
  - and that is?
  ans:
  - to use these letters that casey got from the girl.

- que:
  - what did you tell him?
  ans:
  - i told him it was classified and to forget it.

- que:
  - what was the date of that meeting, general?
  ans:
  - i can't recall exactly, but it was right here in this office.

- que:
  - you have a record of the date and subject?
  ans:
  - certainly, mr. president, in my office.

- que:
  - that would be?
  ans:
  - that would be senator raymond clark, the senior senator from georgia.

  - i don't know whether to laugh at such megalomania, or simply cry.

- que:
  - why in god's name don't you have faith...... in the system of government you're so hell bent to protect?
  ans:
  - you say i've duped the people.

- que:
  - you accuse me of having lost their faith...... and deliberately and criminally shut my ears to the national voice?
  ans:
  - i do.

- que:
  - how did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators?
  ans:
  - that's not where you hear the voice of the people.

- que:
  - you want to defend the united states of america?

  - i think perhaps a question of days, perhaps hours...... certainly weeks.

- que:
  - will you resign, general?
  ans:
  - i will not resign.

- que:
  - anything else...... mr. president?
  ans:
  - i've called a press conference for tomorrow.

- que:
  - come, pull yourself together.
  ans:
  - what's that?

- que:

  ans:
  - no, i'm all right.

- que:
  - what's happening?
  ans:
  - elizabeth and your father are coming to see you.

- que:
  - is that the front door?
  ans:
  - yes, this is it.

- que:
  - well, what's the matter with you?
  ans:
  - you look as if you've been kicked by a horse.

- que:
  - where's henry?
  ans:
  - why...

- que:
  - well?
  ans:
  - he can't be disturbed just now.

- que:
  - i'il soon settle that nonsense.

  - from what, dear?

- que:
  - lose me?
  ans:
  - why, i'il always be with you.

  - maria.

- que:
  - why do you bring her here to me?
  ans:

  ans:
  - eh, my dear, where haven't i been...

- que:
  - it depends, bride, what do you want?
  ans:

- que:
  - are you for a dance?

- que:
  - love you as a woman...
  ans:
  - listen, what do you need that kid for?

- que:
  - where are you going with him?
  ans:
  - life flies away quickly...

- que:

  ans:
  - better go back.

- que:
  - you are glad that they have recruited him, ha?
  ans:
  - yes i am.

- que:
  - and you have missed audition?
  ans:
  - i don't worry, when they hear me they will take me even without it.

- que:
  - listen, in which division is your son?
  ans:
  - artillery, like yours.

- que:
  - where was it?
  ans:
  - here, in the pocket.

- que:
  - and now is most commonly associated with linux and the open source movement.
  ans:
  - and he looked back to me and said, \"oh, yeah and what do you do?

- que:
  - what is linux?
  ans:
  - i see that you've chosen the password mumble, whatever it was.

- que:
  - a hobby computer is wasted.
  ans:
  - how did that begin?

- que:
  - will quality software be written for the hobby market?
  ans:
  - as the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.

- que:
  - one thing you do do is prevent good software from being written.
  ans:
  - who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

- que:
  - what hobbyist can put 3 man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute it for free?
  ans:
  - the fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software.

- que:
  - aren't they making money on hobby software?
  ans:
  - yes, but those who have been reported to us may lose in the end.

- que:
  - and that put me into a moral dilemma, you see?
  ans:
  - because to get one of the modern computers of the day, which was the early 80's, you would have to get a proprietory operating system.

- que:
  - lin us \"or \"line us\"?
  ans:
  - well, you can judge.

- que:
  - and most of them don't know it.
  ans:
  - right?

- que:
  - well, if i install linux.
  ans:
  - i mean what's your thought on that?

- que:
  - it does what webmasters actually need and the combination of apache and linux found its way into a great many commercial shops.
  ans:
  - i get some tangible benefit from doing so, right?

- que:
  - how do we sell products in this environment?
  ans:
  - then i looked at the competition, particularly microsoft.

- que:
  - was there some way they could use our source code against us?
  ans:
  - and that's why i included a reference to eric's paper in my paper.

- que:
  - but i was very very open with him.
  ans:
  - any chairs around here?

- que:
  - the more i told him, the more he started to shake his head like this, and i finally said, you know, \"what's wrong?
  ans:
  - but some people said \"yeah, that was our debutante ball.

- que:
  - you didn't buy?
  ans:
  - no, no, i didn't buy.

- que:
  - to the freedom they can have, or not have, when they use a computer.
  ans:
  - you guys don't know?

- que:
  - well what can we do about it?
  ans:
  - somewhat modified of course.

- que:
  - and we kept asking them, well \"hows it going?
  ans:
  - are things going ok?\".

- que:
  - come on.
  ans:
  - mommy?

- que:
  - i'm trying.

  ans:
  - our grandmother says that she's coming tomorrow with money and clothes.

- que:
  - how early will she be here?
  ans:
  - very early.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because we wanna cook you breakfast.

  ans:

  ans:

  - sorry?
  ans:
  - the language spoken in palestine at the time of christ.

- que:
  - and what does it say?
  ans:
  - the fallen shall rise... in a river of blood.

- que:
  - do you have a moment?
  ans:
  - of course.

- que:
  - or maybe something more substantial?
  ans:
  - yes, that would be very nice.

- que:
  - you dabble in the occult?
  ans:
  - i found them here when i arrived.

- que:
  - i wanted to ask you, did you treat bession?
  ans:
  - you should let me clean that before it gets infected.

- que:
  - or is it those evil spirits?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - people can't really understand, can they?
  ans:
  - if they weren't there... if they didn't see.

- que:
  - so... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - do you miss it?
  ans:
  - being a priest.

- que:
  - gionetti?
  ans:
  - he runs the sanitarium.

- que:
  - what is your name?
  ans:
  - i'm father merrin.

- que:
  - hey, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - hyenas.

- que:
  - did you see that, lancaster?
  ans:
  - the hyenas ignored joseph.

- que:
  - can you hear?
  ans:
  - come with me.

- que:
  - monsieur bession?
  ans:
  - mr. bession.

- que:
  - was it in the church?
  ans:
  - mr. bession.

- que:
  - are you hurt?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - have you drifted so far from god, merrin, that you can't see?
  ans:
  - monsieur bession was touched by the devil.

- que:
  - demonic possession?
  ans:
  - forgive me, father.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - in 1647, the ursuline convent in loudon, france... was plagued by possession.

- que:
  - can i see?
  ans:
  - you threw it away.

- que:
  - jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
  ans:
  - maybe if you could cure my fucking face...

- que:
  - joseph?
  ans:
  - he's coming for you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - he's coming for you.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i had a bad dream.

- que:
  - where is everybody?
  ans:
  - sebituana's baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome.

- que:
  - are you all right?
  ans:
  - yeah, i'm just a little bit tired.

- que:
  - these lesions... they're not from the shock, are they?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - so what is it?
  ans:
  - in this part of the world... it could be a dozen things... but his symptoms don't really match any of them.

- que:
  - will you be all right?
  ans:
  - hmm.

- que:
  - how was nairobi?
  ans:
  - oh, fine.

- que:
  - did you see monsieur bession?
  ans:
  - he's dead.

- que:
  - how?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - did bession talk about what he found under the church?
  ans:
  - there's an ancient temple below, a pagan place... where they used to conduct sacrifices, human sacrifices.

- que:
  - why would they build a church on top of something like that?
  ans:
  - perhaps to purify the site.

- que:
  - he blames the whites.
  ans:
  - but then why bury it?

- que:
  - you think the turkana took jefferies?
  ans:
  - i think this place is on the verge of an uprising.

- que:
  - you disagree?
  ans:
  - in my experience, bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea.

- que:
  - who buried them?
  ans:
  - everybody died.

- que:
  - any answers on jefferies?
  ans:
  - i'm afraid not.

- que:
  - major granville?
  ans:
  - the turkana won't like the show of force.

- que:
  - so, what was it?
  ans:
  - the evil in your church... it has taken emekwi's youngest son... and it is getting stronger.

- que:
  - so you don't want to tell me?
  ans:
  - he says he doesn't have to tell you because it's happening again... right now.

- que:
  - then who's buried in that graveyard?
  ans:
  - i'm sorry.

- que:
  - are you praying... to god?
  ans:
  - i dug up three graves.

- que:
  - what happened here?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what were they hiding?
  ans:
  - that this place is damned.

- que:
  - but it wasn't?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - where did they go?
  ans:
  - no one knows.

- que:
  - what legend?
  ans:
  - savages.

- que:
  - leave me.
  ans:
  - why are you here?

- que:
  - sir?
  ans:
  - i said, leave me.

- que:
  - where's sarah?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - turkana are coming to kill him.

- que:
  - aren't you coming?
  ans:
  - i have to find sarah.

- que:
  - sarah?
  ans:
  - the lord is coming for you.

- que:
  - oh, my god.
  ans:
  - sarah?

- que:
  - bession was sarah's husband?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - she went into the church with him, didn't she?
  ans:
  - francis.

- que:
  - why would he listen to you?
  ans:
  - you.

- que:
  - fucking his only son while you call out his name?
  ans:
  - he doesn't care about this whore.

- que:
  - you have to be strong and concentrate.
  ans:
  - you understand?

- que:
  - can you read this?
  ans:
  - i will start there.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - sarah.

- que:
  - okay?
  ans:
  - thank you.

- que:
  - sarah.
  ans:
  - sarah, what is it?

- que:
  - father?
  ans:
  - she's with god now.

- que:
  - didn't you?
  ans:
  - good bye, mr. semelier.

- que:
  - do you know my mother?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - do i know you?
  ans:
  - my name is semelier.

- que:
  - so you think i'm a thief?
  ans:
  - now you think i'm a thief and a whore.

- que:
  - so what happened?
  ans:
  - this is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for... a representation of a mythical demon.

- que:
  - what makes you think it's in a church in africa?
  ans:
  - a major granville in nairobi is in charge of the dig.

- que:
  - beautiful, aren't they?
  ans:
  - it's a hobby from school days.

- que:
  - what can you tell me about the dig?
  ans:
  - the location is a remote area of the turkana district... called derati.

- que:
  - what have they learned so far?
  ans:
  - that it's a church where no church should be.

- que:
  - how come you've opened the site to the vatican?
  ans:
  - we haven't... officially.

- que:
  - tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
  ans:
  - well, not until i've seen it.

- que:
  - how long have you been with the dig, chuma?
  ans:
  - since the beginning.

- que:
  - what happened here?
  ans:
  - plague.

- que:
  - how many died?
  ans:
  - all of them.

- que:
  - is something bothering you, mate?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - you drink, merrin?
  ans:
  - i shouldn't... but my will is weak.

- que:
  - right, doctor?
  ans:
  - i'm sarah novak.

- que:
  - so how are the interior excavations coming along?
  ans:
  - they're not.

- que:
  - has the structure collapsed?
  ans:
  - no, the church is perfect... but none of the men will enter, those we have left anyway.

- que:
  - why's that?
  ans:
  - i shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.

- que:
  - other than that it's attached to his body?
  ans:
  - could be an allergic reaction or some kind oflocalized infection.

- que:
  - do you know why the men won't enter the church?
  ans:
  - evil spirits.

- que:
  - and do you?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - did he?
  ans:
  - well, he is mistaken.

- que:
  - emekwi, can you see to mr. merrin's bags?
  ans:
  - oh, of course.

- que:
  - is this your first assignment, father?
  ans:
  - before this, i was studying in the archives in the holy sea.

- que:
  - but not really training for missionary work, is it?
  ans:
  - this is strange.

- que:
  - where's jefferies?
  ans:
  - i need to go into the church.

- que:
  - hyenas?
  ans:
  - they've been here ever since we started digging.

- que:
  - what's the matter with him?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - are you out here by yourself?
  ans:
  - it's dangerous.

- que:
  - so what is it you hope to find here?
  ans:
  - the answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before christianity arrived.

- que:
  - you were a priest once, weren't you?
  ans:
  - yes, i was.

- que:
  - how soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
  ans:
  - a few days.

- que:
  - and in the meantime, how do we get in?
  ans:
  - we don't.

- que:
  - is it safe to walk around?
  ans:
  - let's see.

- que:
  - you ever seen anything like it?
  ans:
  - not this far from rome.

- que:
  - who would do something like this?
  ans:
  - the crucifix was broken off from here.

- que:
  - chuma, is there an inventory of what's been found here?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't know.

- que:
  - who would know?
  ans:
  - cause this place has been vandalized.

- que:
  - so where can i find him?
  ans:
  - i need to talk to him.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - he's gone mad.

- que:
  - no one's been inside bession's tent since he fell ill?
  ans:
  - they are superstitious.

- que:
  - and you?
  ans:
  - not superstitious.

- que:
  - where's bession now?
  ans:
  - a sanitorium in nairobi.

- que:
  - how long has he been gone?
  ans:
  - a few weeks.

- que:
  - sorry?

  ans:
  - you are the one, neo.

- que:
  - now, do you still want to meet?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what's this?
  ans:
  - it's necessary, neo.

- que:
  - from what?
  ans:
  - from you.

  ans:
  - because you have been down there.

- que:
  - what's that?

  - ... tumbling down the rabbit hole?
  ans:
  - you could say that.

- que:
  - do you believe in fate, neo?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - i don't like the idea that i'm not in control of my life.

  - the matrix is everywhere.

- que:
  - what truth?
  ans:
  - that you are a slave.

- que:

  ans:

- que:
  - what if he makes it?
  ans:
  - no one's ever made their first jump.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:

  - right, trin?
  ans:
  - i thought it wasn't real.

- que:
  - if you're killed in the matrix...... you die here?
  ans:
  - the body cannot live without the mind.

- que:
  - i keep wondering...... if morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the oracle?

  ans:
  - businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

- que:
  - were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?
  ans:
  - look again.

- que:
  - this isn't the matrix?
  ans:
  - if you are not one of us, you are one of them.

- que:
  - what are they?
  ans:
  - sentient programs.

- que:
  - someone?
  ans:
  - i won't lie to you, neo.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - i've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.

- que:

  - tastee wheat.

- que:
  - did you ever eat tastee wheat?
  ans:

  ans:
  - maybe they got it wrong.

- que:
  - of who?
  ans:
  - the woman in the red dress.

- que:
  - see who?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i used to eat there.

- que:
  - what does that mean?
  ans:
  - that the matrix cannot tell you who you are.

- que:
  - but an oracle can?
  ans:
  - that's different.

- que:
  - did you go to her?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - what did she tell you?
  ans:
  - she told me....

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - we're here.

  - yes.

- que:
  - the beginning?
  ans:
  - of the resistance.

- que:
  - everything?
  ans:
  - she would say she knows enough.

- que:
  - what did she tell you?
  ans:
  - that i would find the one.

- que:
  - what truth?
  ans:
  - there is no spoon.

- que:
  - there is no spoon?
  ans:
  - then you'il see that it is not the spoon that bends.

- que:
  - you're the oracle?
  ans:
  - bingo.

- que:
  - not quite what you were expecting, right?
  ans:
  - almost done.

- que:
  - smell good, don't they?
  ans:
  - i'd ask you to sit down...... but you're not going to anyway.

- que:
  - what vase?
  ans:
  - that vase.

- que:
  - what's really going to bake your noodle later on is...... would you still have broken it if i hadn't said anything?
  ans:
  - you're cuter than i thought.

- que:
  - who?
  ans:
  - not too bright, though.

- que:
  - do you think you are the one?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - you know what that means?
  ans:
  - it's latin.

- que:
  - but what?
  ans:
  - but you already know what i'm going to tell you.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - your next life, maybe.

- que:
  - who knows?
  ans:
  - that's the way these things go.

- que:
  - what's funny?
  ans:
  - morpheus.

- que:
  - are you sure you want to hear this?
  ans:
  - morpheus believes in you, neo.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - you're going to have to make a choice.

- que:
  - remember?
  ans:
  - here...

- que:
  - what is that?
  ans:
  - oh, deja vu.

- que:
  - what did you just say?
  ans:
  - nothing.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - a black cat went past us...... then another just like it.

- que:
  - was it the same cat?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - a deja vu is usually a glitch in the matrix when they change something.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - they're in the walls.

- que:
  - and you are?
  ans:
  - a smith.

- que:
  - is morpheus alive, tank?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - cypher?
  ans:
  - i know.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - making the call.

- que:
  - where's tank?
  ans:
  - you know...

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - god, i wish i could be there...... when they break you.

- que:
  - you call this free?
  ans:
  - all i do is what he tells me to do.

- que:
  - i mean, how can he be the one...... if he's dead?
  ans:
  - you never did answer me before...... if you bought into morpheus 'bullshit.

- que:
  - marveled at its beauty...... its genius?
  ans:
  - billions of people...... just living out their lives.

- que:
  - what are they doing to him?
  ans:
  - they're breaking into his mind.

- que:
  - how much time?
  ans:
  - depends on the mind.

- que:
  - what do they want?
  ans:
  - the leader of every ship is given codes to zion's mainframe computer.

- que:
  - kill morpheus?
  ans:
  - we don't have a choice.

- que:
  - does it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm going in.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - this is loco.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i believe in something.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - i believe i can bring him back.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - going with you.

- que:
  - no\"?
  ans:
  - let me tell you what i believe.

- que:
  - do you know what it is?
  ans:
  - a virus.

- que:
  - okay, so what do you need?
  ans:
  - besides a miracle.

- que:
  - why isn't the serum working?
  ans:
  - perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

- que:
  - can you hear me, morpheus?
  ans:
  - i'm going to be honest...... with you.

- que:
  - isn't it?
  ans:
  - i must get out of here.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - he doesn't know.

- que:
  - know what?
  ans:
  - i think they're trying to save him.

- que:
  - do what?
  ans:
  - you moved like they do.

- que:
  - can you fly that thing?
  ans:
  - not yet.

- que:
  - do you believe it now, trinity?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - an agent.

- que:
  - what is he doing?
  ans:
  - he's beginning to believe.

- que:
  - you hear that, mr. anderson?
  ans:
  - that is the sound of inevitability.

- que:
  - what happened?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - how long?
  ans:
  - five, maybe six minutes.

- que:
  - ... because i love you.

  - the woman in the red dress.

- que:
  - see who?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - what?

- que:
  - but an oracle can?
  ans:
  - that's different.

- que:
  - did you go to her?

  - yes.

- que:
  - what did she tell you?
  ans:
  - she told me...

- que:
  - not quite what you were expecting, right?
  ans:
  - almost done.

- que:
  - smell good, don't they?
  ans:
  - i'd ask you to sit down...... but you're not going to anyway.

- que:
  - what vase?
  ans:
  - that vase.

- que:

  ans:
  - not too bright, though.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - your next life, maybe.

  - are you sure you want to hear this?
  ans:
  - morpheus believes in you, neo.

- que:

  - what happened?
  ans:
  - a black cat went past us...... then another just like it.

- que:
  - was it the same cat?
  ans:
  - i'm not sure.

- que:
  - what is it?
  ans:
  - a dj vu is usually a glitch in the matrix when they change something.

- que:
  - where are they?
  ans:
  - they're in the walls.

- que:
  - and you are?
  ans:
  - a smith.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - god, i wish i could be there...... when they break you.

- que:
  - you call this free?
  ans:
  - all i do is what he tells me to do.

- que:
  - i mean, how can he be the one...... if he's dead?
  ans:
  - you never did answer me before...... if you bought into morpheus 'bullshit.

- que:
  - marveled at its beauty...... its genius?
  ans:
  - billions of people...... just living out their lives.

- que:
  - what are they doing to him?
  ans:
  - they're breaking into his mind.

- que:
  - how much time?
  ans:
  - depends on the mind.

- que:
  - what do they want?
  ans:
  - the leader of every ship is given codes to zion's mainframe computer.

- que:
  - kill morpheus?
  ans:
  - we don't have a choice.

  - does it?
  ans:
  - i don't know.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the oracle.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - i'm going in.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:

  ans:
  - because i believe in something.

  - what?
  ans:
  - i believe i can bring him back.

- que:
  - what are you doing?
  ans:
  - going with you.

- que:

- que:
  - do you know what it is?
  ans:
  - a virus.

- que:
  - okay, so what do you need?
  ans:
  - besides a miracle.

- que:
  - why isn't the serum working?
  ans:
  - perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

- que:
  - can you hear me, morpheus?
  ans:
  - i'm going to be honest...... with you.

- que:
  - isn't it?
  ans:
  - i must get out of here.

- que:
  - do you understand?
  ans:
  - he doesn't know.

- que:
  - know what?
  ans:
  - i think they're trying to save him.

- que:
  - do what?
  ans:

  ans:
  - five, maybe six minutes.

- que:
  - flat or pumps?

- que:
  - you like him, don't you?
  ans:
  - you like watching him.

- que:
  - you understand?
  ans:
  - morpheus believes he is the one.

- que:
  - do you?
  ans:
  - it doesn't matter what i believe.

- que:
  - didn't he say that there was a bart porter...... who at one time was a member of the committee?
  ans:
  - that's out.

- que:
  - why do you think it's magruder?
  ans:
  - because he was second in command under mitchell.

- que:
  - why do you think it's magruder?
  ans:
  - i think it's magruder because one time he was temporary head...... of the committee to re elect, before mitchell.

  - what?
  ans:
  - listen, we go back there...... and you ask her who \"p \"is.

- que:
  - i say to her, \"who is 'p '?

  - obviously, because certain people lied to the prosecutor.

- que:
  - they \"meaning the white house?
  ans:
  - the committee's not an independent operation.

  ans:
  - yeah, but i think i woke him up.

- que:
  - do you have good notes?
  ans:
  - verbatim.

- que:
  - he really said that about mrs. graham?
  ans:
  - well, cut the words \"her tit \"and print it.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - this is a family newspaper.

- que:
  - do you trust him?
  ans:
  - yeah.

- que:
  - what i can't figure out is, what is a real denial?

- que:

- que:
  - why did it take you two weeks to tell us this, sally?
  ans:
  - i guess i don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have.

- que:
  - you're claiming it was a misunderstanding?
  ans:
  - absolutely.

- que:
  - i don't remember her getting that much wrong before, do you?
  ans:
  - that's a real bullshit question, woodward.

- que:
  - i mean, was it a restaurant, or her apartment, or a bar...?

  - there's nothing bad about it.

- que:
  - want to do it that way?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - two questions?
  ans:
  - we understand.

- que:
  - would we be wrong?
  ans:
  - let me put it this way.

- que:
  - you wouldn't?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - little boy or girl?
  ans:
  - it's a girl.

- que:
  - will you give our best to her?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - did he say john?
  ans:

  ans:
  - i happen to love this country.

- que:
  - woodward?
  ans:
  - i'm sure.

- que:
  - i told you.
  ans:
  - how many fucking sources do they think we've got?

- que:

  - hang up, right?
  ans:
  - that's right.

- que:
  - you got it?
  ans:
  - i'm going to start counting.

- que:
  - everything's okay?
  ans:
  - i said if i get up to 10 and you don't hang up, it's solid.

- que:
  - did he confirm it?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - would you comment on your testimony before the grand jury?
  ans:
  - my attorney will answer that question.

- que:
  - did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity?
  ans:
  - none, whatsoever.

- que:
  - why is the post trying to do it?
  ans:
  - nothin '.

- que:
  - didn't you say the fbl had the information on haldeman in the files?
  ans:
  - because we have it in the notes...... from the conversation we had on the phone.

- que:
  - i can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards.
  ans:
  - what the hell are you talking about?

- que:
  - are we being set up?
  ans:

  ans:
  - were we wrong?

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me over the phone?
  ans:
  - woodward says phones aren't safe.

- que:
  - who's doing it?
  ans:
  - it's being done.

- que:
  - what happened to that justice source of yours?
  ans:
  - i guess i made instructions too complicated.

- que:
  - why didn't he?
  ans:
  - because nobody asked.

- que:
  - what else did he say?
  ans:
  - he said everyone is involved.

- que:
  - you know the results of the latest gallup poll?
  ans:
  - half the country never even heard of the word \"watergate.

- que:
  - mr. president, are you ready to take the constitutional oath?
  ans:
  - if you will place your left hand on the bible and raise your right hand...... and please repeat after me.

- que:
  - but who to send?
  ans:
  - master windu still fights on dantooine.

- que:
  - indeed.
  ans:
  - what are we going to do?

- que:
  - truly if you were sith, would this contest be not over?
  ans:
  - it would not be so easy to defeat a sith.

- que:
  - have you been watching, master?
  ans:
  - i have indeed, lord tyranus.

- que:
  - what is your bidding?
  ans:
  - a jedi named anakin skywalker.

- que:
  - what was that?
  ans:
  - i don't know, general.

- que:
  - under control?
  ans:
  - i don't think so.

- que:
  - you have his coordinates?
  ans:
  - then plug them in.

- que:
  - you have the coordinates?
  ans:
  - yes, general.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - the crystal is the heart of the blade.

- que:
  - may i remind our master jedi we have a more pressing mission?
  ans:
  - a slight detour.

- que:
  - huh?
  ans:
  - hmm.

- que:
  - ilum?
  ans:
  - that planet is on the other side of the system.

- que:
  - a slight detour?
  ans:
  - well, actually, i don't have a more important place to be.

- que:
  - r2, does this weather affect your sensors?
  ans:
  - not in the slightest. or so he says.

- que:
  - alone?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - what is it, r2?
  ans:
  - oh.

- que:
  - r2 says there are two more still out there.
  ans:
  - where?

- que:
  - uh, 3po, could you get my coat?
  ans:
  - of course, miss padm.

- que:
  - but pain my heart is.
  ans:
  - what is it, r2?

- que:
  - what troubles you, master yoda?
  ans:
  - nearly destroyed the temple was.

- que:

  ans:
  - that's close enough, r4.

- que:
  - obi wan?
  ans:
  - yes, sir.

- que:
  - master?
  ans:
  - go.

- que:
  - it's close, but where?
  ans:
  - it's all around us.

- que:
  - why weren't the jedi able to stop this assassination?
  ans:
  - i cannot believe they do.

- que:
  - master yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
  ans:
  - worse than war, i fear...

- que:
  - what do you sense, master?
  ans:
  - impossible to see...

- que:
  - do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
  ans:
  - our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of naboo.

- que:
  - to what end?
  ans:
  - i don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...

- que:
  - do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
  ans:
  - chancellor, if i may comment, i do not believe the...\"... \"situation is that serious.

- que:
  - kenobi.
  ans:
  - annie?

- que:
  - no assassin will try that way.
  ans:
  - ani?

- que:
  - any activity up here?
  ans:
  - quiet as a tomb.

- que:
  - you're using her as bait?
  ans:
  - it was her idea...

- que:
  - and yours are?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - i try, master.
  ans:
  - because of your mother?

- que:
  - why do i think you are going to be the death of me?
  ans:
  - don't say that master...

- que:
  - then why don't you listen to me?
  ans:
  - i will.

- que:
  - can you see him?
  ans:
  - i believe that 'he 'is actually a 'she '.

- que:
  - where are you going?
  ans:
  - to get a drink.

- que:
  - you want some death sticks?
  ans:
  - you don't want to sell me death sticks.

- que:
  - why couldn't we see this attack on the senator?
  ans:
  - masking the future is this disturbance in the force.

- que:
  - do you think they are behind this?
  ans:
  - out there, they are.

- que:
  - do you think obi wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force?
  ans:
  - only if he chooses to follow his destiny.

- que:
  - pride?!?
  ans:
  - you believe you have a firm grip on politics but you are way too young to understand the situation.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - annie...

- que:
  - it is your name, isn't it?
  ans:
  - it's anakin.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - because i can see what you're thinking.

- que:
  - ahh... so, you have jedi powers too?
  ans:
  - then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.

- que:
  - do you need assistance?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for dexter.

- que:
  - waddya want him for?
  ans:
  - dexter's not in trouble.

- que:
  - are they friendly?
  ans:
  - even in my adventures since i haven't seen a more beautiful place.

- que:
  - are you allowed to love?
  ans:
  - i never understood why he quit.

- que:
  - how long have these attempts been going on?
  ans:
  - i don't want anything to happen to my daughter.

- que:
  - there's something else?
  ans:
  - master, he should not be given this assignment.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - he has a... an emotional connection with her.

- que:
  - has master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
  ans:
  - probing the dark side is a dangerous process.

- que:
  - could you live like that?
  ans:
  - ... no, you're right.

- que:
  - he is well, i hope.
  ans:
  - i'm expected?

- que:
  - jedi council.
  ans:
  - who commissioned this cloning activity?

- que:
  - master?
  ans:
  - they only work on the weak minded.

- que:
  - all right, i get the picture... whatever happened to him?
  ans:
  - no.

- que:
  - may we see him?
  ans:
  - sure.

- que:
  - was your trip productive?
  ans:
  - fairly.

- que:
  - that right?
  ans:
  - your clones are very impressive.

- que:
  - i'm a jedi.
  ans:
  - aren't we all?

- que:
  - whaddayaknow?
  ans:
  - i've come to see my mother.

- que:
  - what's it like?
  ans:
  - cliegg lars.

- que:
  - what are they doing?
  ans:
  - the droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity.

- que:
  - do you have any idea who that may be?
  ans:
  - with the forename darth, a sith he must be.

- que:
  - do you believe he could be the mysterious sido dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
  ans:
  - perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.

- que:
  - do you need help?
  ans:
  - oh, miss padme, i'm so happy.

- que:
  - anakin, what's wrong?
  ans:
  - i... i killed them.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - not just the men... the women and children too.

- que:
  - sometimes we must break the law in order to act in its best interest.
  ans:
  - who can deny these are exceptional times?

- que:
  - why are you here?
  ans:
  - i am searching for jango fett.

- que:
  - what?!?
  ans:
  - it's my job to protect you and it's too dangerous.

- que:
  - aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?
  ans:
  - without your cooperation i can do nothing to stop their execution.

- que:
  - am i also to be executed?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't think of such an offense.

- que:
  - danger?
  ans:
  - oh, no i shouldn't think so.

- que:
  - do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
  ans:
  - you are committing an act of war.

- que:
  - what are you talking about?
  ans:
  - i love you.

- que:
  - what are your orders?
  ans:
  - the force is with us, my master.

- que:
  - victory, you say?
  ans:
  - not a victory.

- que:
  - do you think it will really come to war?
  ans:
  - hmm, the dark side clouds everything.

- que:
  - do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
  ans:
  - our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo.

- que:
  - the situation is that serious?
  ans:
  - no, but i do, senator.

- que:
  - please?
  ans:
  - the thought of losing you... is unbearable.

- que:
  - you fell into that nightmare, master... and i rescued you, remember?
  ans:
  - oh... yes.

- que:
  - it has been far too long, master kenobi.
  ans:
  - obi?

- que:
  - ani?
  ans:
  - my goodness, you've grown.

- que:
  - why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to fiind the killer?
  ans:
  - protection is a job for local security, not jedi.

- que:
  - any activity up here?
  ans:
  - quiet as a tomb.

- que:
  - what's going on?
  ans:
  - ah, she covered the cameras.

- que:
  - what is she thinking?
  ans:
  - she programmed r2 to warn us if there is an intruder.

- que:
  - i know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, master?
  ans:
  - you're using her as bait.

- que:
  - and yours are?
  ans:
  - possibly.

- que:
  - because of your mother?
  ans:
  - he went that way.

- que:
  - why do i get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?
  ans:
  - don't say that, master.

- que:
  - then why don't you listen to me?
  ans:
  - i am trying.

- que:
  - can you see him?
  ans:
  - i think he is a she... and i think she is a changeling.

- que:
  - where are you going, master?
  ans:
  - for a drink.

- que:
  - you wanna buy some death sticks?
  ans:
  - you don't want to sell me death sticks.

- que:

  - and who hired you?
  ans:
  - it was just a job.

  - what about senator amidala?
  ans:
  - she will still need protecting.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.

- que:
  - why not?
  ans:
  - it makes me feel uncomfortable.

- que:
  - what if they realize you've left the capital?
  ans:
  - well, then my jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.

- que:
  - you wanna cup o 'jawa juice?
  ans:
  - oh, yes.

- que:
  - so, my friend, what can i do for ya?
  ans:
  - you can tell me what this is.

  ans:
  - thank you.

  - well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there?
  ans:
  - kamino.

- que:
  - is it in the republic?
  ans:
  - no, no.

- que:
  - are they friendly?
  ans:
  - oh, depends.

  ans:
  - on how good your manners are... and how big your, uh... pocketbook is.

- que:
  - did you call for assistance?
  ans:
  - yes, yes, i did.

- que:
  - are you having a problem, master kenobi?
  ans:
  - yes, um, i'm looking for a planetary system called kamino.

- que:
  - are you sure you have the right coordinates?
  ans:
  - according to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the rishi maze.

- que:
  - are you allowed to love?
  ans:
  - i thought that was forbidden for a jedi.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - i'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.

- que:
  - hmm?
  ans:
  - liam, the shades.

- que:
  - a thought?
  ans:
  - anyone.

- que:
  - master?
  ans:
  - because someone erased it from the archive memory.

- que:
  - that's impossible, isn't it?
  ans:
  - dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

- que:
  - do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the republic?
  ans:
  - not if they feel threatened.

- que:
  - what is your suggestion, master jedi?
  ans:
  - oh, anakin's not a jedi yet.

- que:
  - i'm expected?
  ans:

  - what do you know about kazamatsuri?
  ans:
  - you never know what he's thinking.

- que:
  - like this?
  ans:
  - no, not even close.

- que:
  - but why did he steal the sword?
  ans:
  - see.

- que:
  - why didn't you say so earlier?
  ans:
  - he's a mean one, alright.

- que:
  - why me?
  ans:
  - you have a fiance to consider.

- que:
  - sir, how would you like to have some fun?
  ans:
  - first, a spot of gambling to win some money, then a whorehouse for some real fun.

  - what do you say?

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - i reckon he's preparing an army to attack us.

- que:
  - what about my two friends?
  ans:
  - the one called suzuki is fine.

- que:
  - are you hungry?

- que:
  - are you sure you won't eat something?
  ans:
  - i'il make some gruel.

- que:
  - but you agree with me, don't you father?
  ans:
  - regardless, stay in bed for now.

- que:
  - do you like the sea?
  ans:
  - yes, i do.

- que:
  - how many men have you killed?
  ans:
  - please tell me, sir.

- que:
  - how many?
  ans:
  - i've lost count.

- que:
  - it makes an excellent medicine.
  ans:
  - from just brushing against it?

- que:
  - is that so?
  ans:
  - you're so knowledgeable.

- que:
  - was it?
  ans:
  - this is a lovely place.

- que:
  - are you alright?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - i wonder what caused that?
  ans:
  - but it really is delicious.

- que:
  - why are you both looking at me like that?
  ans:
  - we escaped with just a mud bath, that's all.

- que:
  - so that's all it was?
  ans:
  - we got totally covered in mud.

- que:
  - would you care for a drink?
  ans:
  - no, thank you.

- que:
  - did i tell you about his nosebleed?
  ans:
  - according to the report, he's sufficiently recovered to gather herbs with a maiden.

- que:
  - whatever is he thinking?
  ans:
  - enough about him.

- que:
  - where is the sword?
  ans:
  - still with kazamatsuri.

- que:
  - kazamatsuri, you say?
  ans:
  - you must have heard.

- que:
  - you're a friend?
  ans:
  - i wouldn't say friend, but...

- que:
  - terribly sorry.
  ans:
  - attacked by kazamatsuri, you say?

- que:
  - i'il come back when mr. kazamatsuri's not indisposed.
  ans:
  - are you alright?

- que:
  - who on earth was that?
  ans:
  - begging your pardon.

- que:
  - you two again?
  ans:
  - we are to escort heishiro back to the domain.

- que:
  - don't you agree?
  ans:
  - so skillful, but hidden away in the boondocks.

- que:
  - why?
  ans:
  - because i'm a member of the underworld.

- que:
  - how do you feel now?
  ans:
  - i thought i'd die.

- que:
  - why didn't you tell me earlier?
  ans:
  - i swapped a fake for this, the real sword.

- que:
  - father is ill?
  ans:
  - no time to argue, sir.

- que:
  - how long have you lived like this?
  ans:
  - since i was this big.

- que:
  - doesn't your father wish to work as an official?
  ans:
  - he's not the kind of man to push himself forward.

- que:
  - may i help you?
  ans:
  - yes.

- que:
  - it may seem rude to ask...... but why did he adopt you in the first place?
  ans:
  - i was relieved to hear you're going to the whorehouse.

- que:
  - really truly?
  ans:
  - thank you so much.

- que:
  - it's councilor inukai's lad.
  ans:
  - watch?

  ans:
  - c'mon, let's go.

- que:
  - hanbei mizoguchi?
  ans:
  - let's have a duel.

- que:
  - why so eager to cross swords with me?
  ans:
  - it's perfectly natural for a master swordsman to fight.

- que:
  - you mean inukai?
  ans:
  - he's the stupid son of an hereditary councilor.

- que:
  - how about another helping?
  ans:
  - mr. inukai.

- que:
  - he's hopeless.
  ans:
  - you remember, don't you?

- que:
  - how did you know?
  ans:
  - the wind brought your scent to me.

- que:
  - why not quit your rank... and help me to take over this area?

  ans:

  ans:
  - oh no...

- que:
  - for what other possible reason?
  ans:
  - i'm ashamed to say...

- que:
  - why do you stop me from killing a wicked man like him?
  ans:
  - i killed a man once.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - grant me a favor.

- que:
  - does koharu know that you killed her father?
  ans:

  - what's wrong with you?
  ans:
  - look at you with your tight ass and your perfect little tits.

  - get what?
  ans:
  - you wouldn't give a guy like me the fucking time of day.

- que:
  - what?
  ans:
  - it looks like you lost your bet on christopher.

- que:
  - he sure isn't sleeping with you now, but you know what?
  ans:
  - don't give jason the money, give it to me.

- que:
  - so, what did you get out of this?
  ans:
  - one look at the expression on your face.

- que:
  - i mean, come on...... what are the chances?
  ans:
  - oh, by the way, your story...... it sucked.

- que:
  - who's ever had sex where someone didn't get hurt?
  ans:
  - you're bitter.

- que:
  - where'd you get the nerd act?
  ans:
